Dear customer, my name is Gustavo from the EMEA Kernel Team and I will assist
you before an Engineer in your GEO and language can take this ticket.

    "High "inactive memory" value"

This is the behavior of the "page cache" when you work with big datasets:

  Linux, therefore, implements a modified version of LRU, called the two-list
  strategy . Instead of maintaining one list, the LRU list, Linux keeps two
  lists: the active list and the inactive list . Pages on the active list are
  considered “hot” and are not available for eviction. Pages on the inactive
  list are available for cache eviction. Pages are placed on the active list
  only when they are accessed while already residing on the inactive list.
