Thanks for your email, Eva. Good afternoon.

I am attaching to this email:

  * gfigueir-diploma-transcript.pdf - the transcript of the diploma
  * gfigueir-evaluation-of-degree.pdf - evaluation of my degree by an expert
  * gfigueir-accomodation-contract.pdf - accommodation contract

If the evaluation of degree is not enough, please let me know so I can request
a "confirmation of practice" to my previous employer. I have never asked for
that though, so I'm not sure how to do and how long it will take.

I was not aware I should apply for the extension, that's why I didn't. So
because of this, the whole process will take from 3-4 months :( 

It is easy to get the police record (I can do it online), but I have to check 
if I can superlegalize it in the Brazilian Embassy in Prague. I will let you
know about my findings. If this is not possible, I will have to ask my parents
to do it for me in Brazil, but this can take some weeks (which should not be a
problem as we need to wait 30 days to apply for the employee card).

I will send you latter tomorrow a copy of:

  * scanned copy of current work contract

I will ask to be sent via mail:
  
  * notarized/superlegalized copy of diploma

With my Brazilian passport I can stay in Czech for 90 days without Visa. I
will ask my embassy if they can prolong this somehow.
