I just got an email from Suse saying it will take 3-4 months to get the visa.

The problem is that I didn't ask for visa extension 30 days before my visa
expires since I didn't know I would need that. Now they will report vacancy
position at labor office and they have to wait 30 days to start the
employment card application. So I will need a new visa, and all the documents
a new visa requires.

They need superlegalized documents, and I need to check if the embassy can
provide this service.

I don't know what to do, so that's why I'm writing to you. I need to
understand what I can do and what are my options. I cannot stay in Czcech for
more than 3 months per year without visa. That's the maximum time my passport
allows me.

I will try to ask in the embassy if they can allow me to stay more than 3
months here, so I wont need to go to Brazil. But if this is not possible, I
will have to go back to Brazil for at least 1 month and a half.

I have now on my bank account 38k, you saved the 20k I send you and I expect
to be payed around 38k this month (already subtracting rent and alimony for
this month) wich will bring my savings to around 96k.

96k will cover rent and alimony for 5 months, not counting food, or 4 months
counting food (6k per month for food).

If have to go to Brazil, then I need to subtract 30K from my savings for the
plane ticket, which will give me 3 months of rent/alimony/food.
