I just got an email from Suse saying it will take 3-4 months to get the visa.

The problem is that I didn't ask for visa extension 30 days before my visa
expires since I didn't know I would need that. Now they will report vacancy
position at labor office and they have to wait 30 days to start the
employment card application. So I will need a new visa, and all the documents
a new visa requires.

I don't know what to do, so that's why I'm writing to you. I need to
understand what I can do and what are my options. I cannot stay in Czcech for
more than 3 months per year without visa. That's the maximum time my passport
allows me. Besides there are documents I need to fetch and do stuff.

  * Can I superlegalize my police record in the embassy?
