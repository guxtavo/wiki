Thanks for your email, Eva. Good morning.

I am attaching to this email:

  * gfigueir-diploma-transcript.pdf - the transcript of the diploma
  * gfigueir-evaluation-of-degree.pdf - evaluation of my degree by an expert

If the evaluation of degree is not enough, please let me know so I can request
a "confirmation of practice" to my previous employer. I have never asked for
that though.

I was not aware I should apply for the extension, that's why I didn't. So
because of this the whole process will take from 3-4 months :( 

Do you need the police record to be superlegalized? I will need some time to
provide you all the originals, but I guess we have 1 month for that, right?

I will send you soon:

  * current acomodation crontract
  * current work contract
  * police

Can you please tell me which documents you need original?
