I've been working as a Kernel Support Engineer in Red Hat for the past 3 years,
and before I acted in different roles in Engineering Support. My main studies
concentrate on Unix Kernel Design and implementation and C Programming
Language.

Other interests include networking, shell scripting, performance and RT Patch.

In my spare time I try to read as much Aerospace books I can, do table tennis
trick shots,
