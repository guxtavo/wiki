# 2019

## W14

	* Finally moved to i3 (still with gnome-terminal)
	* working on prototype for ECO02 (np)
	* still don't know how to track pull requests
		From gitlab it's easy:

		 $ w3m -dump
		https://gitlab.suse.de/gfigueir.atom?feed_token=26rq5ZPRvrhci2NsSFQ1 | grep
		"<link" | grep merge_reques

	* from github you need to check the api further
