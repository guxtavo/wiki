SpaceX delivered the best in the peak of winter. The farring opens up 
reveiling a red tesla with a doll in a spacesuite in the driver's seat.
Don't Panic! reads in the navigation screen. Back on earth the two F9 
touch the ground milisseconds away from each other, just meters away. 
All camera angles show an espetacular view. Cameras set before, in a
simulation. They must have run this simulation many times inside 
SpaceX's cluster, they even render it on youtube hours before the feat.
