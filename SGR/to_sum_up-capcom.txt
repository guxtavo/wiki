       These are my long running studies / objectives and a measure of
       how comfortable I feel working on them. _You_ are looking at a
       Linux Software Engineer with background in 'Support', 'DevOps',
       'Performance Tunning' and 'Infrastructure'.

DESCRIPTION
       I dream on building a Space Craft and a Computer for 'Linux Student's.

       As an R&D Software Engineer in SUSE, I use OBS to _build_ anything,
       help Support with advanced debugging, coordinate and help Develpers,
       create _patches_ and do backports to different code streams,
       participate in the developing and operation of my team's tools


       From HTML to switches. From Unix servers to routers and appliances.
       From mission-critical to disater recovery and 24x7. From integration
       to CI. From managing communities to DevOps. Focus on low-level.
