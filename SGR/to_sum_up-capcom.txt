       my own scripts to deal with workflow and help optimize R&D resources
       in an ever more challenging services department.

       From HTML to switches. From Unix servers to routers and appliances.
       From mission-critical to disater recovery and 24x7. From integration
       to CI. From managing communities to DevOps. Focus on low-level.
