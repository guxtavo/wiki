       These are my long running studies / objectives and a measure of
       how comfortable I feel working on them. *You* are looking for a
       Senior Linux Engineer.

DESCRIPTION
       My introduction to Computer  Science was _HTML_, writing it.   After 2
       years I was introduced to  switches,  routers and  _Unix_  servers.  I
       worked replacing failing Unix  systems for  Linux appliances or adding
       more Unix boxes, and this was  happening every 9 months or so. After 4
       years I moved to an  ISP to  create  a   _network appliance_  and keep
       hundreds of devices and  services in a reliable state.  In two years I
       was entrusted with 400+ devices, taking care of disater recovery plans
       and complex network maintenance and improvement.  I tried teaching PKI
       and  _iptables_  at university, but didn't like because of the lack of
       interest from the students.   This  happened  in  a period of about 11
       years.  Since 2008 I spent 5 years  _integrating_  high-throughput SMS
       gateways in  complex and  _mission-critical_   networks.   Then I  was
       invited to move to Brno, to get more in depth with the  _Linux kernel_
       and   x86_64  architecture  in Support,  but  also develop some people
       skills. As I was eyeing a position at software maintenance team, I was
       hired  by  SUSE  to work  with  _CI_,  maintainers  and  support team,
       delivering   temporary  fixes  to customers and partners   and helping
       coordination.
