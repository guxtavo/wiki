Symptoms you are describing are matching following known issue with Xeon CPUs
Servers with Intel® Xeon® Processor E5, Intel® Xeon® Processor E5 v2, or
Intel® Xeon® Processor E7 v2 and certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
6 kernels become unresponsive/hung or incur a kernel panic
https://access.redhat.com/solutions/433883

The issue triggers after server has been rebooted after more than 200 days of
hardware uptime (reboots do not count). Several of Intel Xeon models have a
bug which causes TSC (timestamp counter) to not be reset after reboot, after
~200 days it will overflow and cause behaviour similar to what you are
observing (sluggish performance, processes getting stuck, unreasonable run
times). To get system in order one has to power cycle the server (turn
off/turn on) to force CPU to fully reset. Once system is up and running,
please consider updating the kernel as newer kernel is preventing this HW bug
to have any effects (fixed kernel versions are mentioned in article above).
