SIEM Technology
===============

In the field of computer security, security information and event management (SIEM) software products and services combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). They provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications.

The term security information event management (SIEM), coined by Mark Nicolett and Amrit Williams of Gartner in 2005,[6]

  * the product capabilities of gathering, analyzing and presenting information from network and security devices
  * identity and access-management applications
  * vulnerability management and policy-compliance tools
  * operating-system, database and application logs
  * external threat data
