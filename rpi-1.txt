# drone

A drone which only job is to go up. How far up a drone can go? 3.4km

  * calculate how much power the drone needs to lift the payload
  * can I install solar arrays to extend flight or is it just a short flight?
  * RTT for geostationary orbit is 239ms

# Raspberry pi power consumption

  2.5A - Recommended PSU current capacity (powering 4 usbs)
  1.2A - Maximum total USB peripheral current draw  
~400mA - Typical bare-board active current consumption
 250mA - Camera module drawn

  ==  Power drawn in amps ==
