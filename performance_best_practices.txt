* Isolate housekeeping processes and application processes in different CPUs 


Did they try to isolate housekeeping CPUs and application CPUs in different numa nodes? Tuna and tuned are available since 6.5 I think. You can use isolcpus in kernel command line to isolate the application CPUs (if not done yet). Then examine "pstree" output and usa tuna or taskset to start the hpc/performance application bound the the right cpus. The system has 16 cores and 17 running processes on average, and cache locality problems can exist in such workloads.

Do they know abi between major versions is kept? There is a risk of a new bug being introduced in future versions, but the amount of improvements can generally outweigh the risk for new regressions/defects. Moreover if they have time to test they have time to reboot twice to rollback the kernel change.

Changes in rhel6 kernel between 6.3 and 6.8:

[rhel6]$ glo kernel-2.6.32-279.el6..kernel-2.6.32-358.el6 | wc -l
5173 #patches from 6.3 until 6.4

[rhel6]$ glo kernel-2.6.32-279.el6..kernel-2.6.32-431.el6 | wc -l
11533 #patches from 6.3 until 6.5

[rhel6]$ glo kernel-2.6.32-279.el6..kernel-2.6.32-504.el6 | wc -l
17237#patches from 6.3 until 6.6

[rhel6]$ glo kernel-2.6.32-279.el6..kernel-2.6.32-573.el6 | wc -l     
23699 #patches from 6.3 until 6.7

[rhel6]$ glo kernel-2.6.32-279.el6..kernel-2.6.32-642.el6 | wc -l                    
28965 #patches from 6.3 until 6.8

Do I get it right that there is a ~20% difference between good node and bad node regarding interruptions?

  Bad node interrupts   ++++++++++ 16k
  Good node interrupts  ++++++++   13k

The more IRQs, the more time ksoftirqd will be called, thus less time for user-space (majority).





- HPC has been facing performance issue and as due it, 6 nodes are been removed which had issue.
   
  > the hardware is from 2012 according to bios. When is the EOL? What lm_sensors is telling us during the tests?

- Linpack is the tool used to measure the performance of the systems.

  > What is the baseline? We need to set the expectation. This can go on and on until we draw the line.

- Turbostat command has been used to measure wattage consumption of the per CPU (Expected = 110w to 115w, Current = 70w )

  > Again, what is the core temperature according to lm_sensors? Any alarms in remote management console?

- C-states has been disabled in the system from the hardware end itself.

  > Does it mean they have the "performance" profile chosen in "IBM's remote management thingy"? I recommend checking our power management guide:

  https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Power_Management_Guide/index.html

  If the application is IO bound it is recommended to disable power management for HBA. The same can be done for NIC and other peripherals. 

- With the help of linpack tool computation should be more than 300 gflops

  > It would be nice to have a table withe the hosts, time/tps to run the data set just for comparison.

- In the call asked them to disable c-states by kernel command line but they said they can not reboot the node as issue is reproduced only after some uptime of about 50 days.

  > You can ask them to double check the BIOS (in this case IBM's remote management console)

    Kernel upgrade might be necessary:
    
    [rhel6]$ glo --grep="performance" kernel-2.6.32-279.el6.. | wc -l
    542

* scheduler affinity in numa systems
* cgroups and limits
* updates
* what are you measuring?
