# Intro

Wok is a solution for restaurants and food trucks. It automates order taking,
relying on the customer to have a smartphone. After adding the items to the
shopping cart.

Raspberry Pi, Debian, Apache, Ruby

The rpi3 will have an open access point, e.g. "Wok - My Restaurant Name", and
upon connecting the user will be redirected to authentication page, which is
in fact an order page. After submitting the order and receiving the ticket
number, the user will be able to access the internet if it is available. The
internet speed can be limited to to save bandwidth

## Workflow
