# Intro

Wok is a solution for restaurants and food trucks. It automates order taking,
relying on the customer to have a smartphone. After adding the items to the
shopping cart.

Raspberry Pi, Debian, Apache, Ruby

The rpi3 will have an open access point, e.g. "Wok - My Restaurant Name", and
upon connecting the user will be redirected to authentication page, which is
in fact an order page. After submitting the order and receiving the ticket
number, the user will be able to access the internet if it is available. The
internet speed can be limited to to save bandwidth

# Architecture

The system will run in read only mode, which means it will need a maintenance
window to flush the data to disk and to connect to a remote backup server if
available.

The user must inform a slot for the 2 hour maintenance window, on which
everything is consolidated. In the MW - maintenance window - the system will
also be checked for health, and updated in case of security treats. During
this time the ordering system cannot be used.

the data once a day. For that, it will need a 2 hours maintenance time slot
where it will sync up the data to cloud. The system will still work regardless
of the backup status, which 1011 8168 35 / 6100 v,s201806 11k
