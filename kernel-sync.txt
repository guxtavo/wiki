# Interruptions

top half - atomic
bottom half - can sleep, spin locks

# sync (lock) methods - critical section

atomic versus ordering

  spin locks             short time   - ns      - doesn't block - non recursive
  mutex                  longer time  - ms      - block
  semaphores             signaling    - ms-sec  - block
  completion variables   signaling    - ms-sec  - block

mutex
  -> mutual exclusion
  -> binary
