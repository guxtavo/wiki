I bought another keyboard and this time I will fit it with a 3A+. After using a
dremel to make room and cut holes for the SD card, audio jack, HDMI and USB
power, I realized the headers and the USB-A on the 3A+ will have to go so the
profile can be lowered.

    * Go to EMS
    * buy solder iron
    * buy hot plastic gun

The next tasks are:

    * What to solder in a usb cable - jumping a usb cable
    * Make schematic of the connection
    * Remove the headers with solder iron
    * Remove USB-A with solder iron
    * Remove the microusb with solder iron
    * jump the 2 usbs

USB connection schematic:
