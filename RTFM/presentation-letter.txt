Dear recruiter,

My name is Gustavo (capcom on IRC), and I'm currently employed as a Linux
Developer, L3 Support at SUSE, based in Brno - Czech Republic, reporting
remotely to office in Prague.

I'm currently looking into re-locating back to Brazil in August 2021, so I'm
interest in remote positions only. I understand that some positions require
some "office dynamics", in which case I appreciate the attention.

My stack is built around OpenSUSE Tumbleweed (I'm an agile person), tmux (that
lives in the shell), vim and git, and I have great curiosity for kernels (not
just Linux) and low-level protocols.

I'm rooted in some niches:
    * Unix              20+ years
    * ISP / Net.Mgmt.    7+ years
    * Telecom            5+ years
    * Open Source        5+ years

The years in Open Source are working in SUSE and Red Hat.

Currently I'm honing my skills at:
    * ftrace - tracing framework for the Linux kernel
    * C language - K&R
    * git - ProGit2

Doing DevOps and some management:
    * Helping release code and coordination of the L3 tooling team
    * Sharing bugfixing/maintainership of a few packages with 10+ other devs

Projects I've hacked in the past:
    * Captive portal (circa 2003, closed source)
    * Diagnostic information tool for Unix (circa 2005, open source)

I'm also know for:
    * Doing table tennis trick shots
    * Artful basketball player
    * Chiptune music enthusiast
    * Aerospace geek
    * Building an opensource computer hardware platform

I hope I could give some clarity to ease your decision process, but if you
have any questions don't hesitate to ask for further details. I hope this will
enable you to select a position that could align with my skills so we can
hopefuly come to a final agreement.
