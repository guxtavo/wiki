How to get there
Work towards becoming STSE:
Participate in local and global projects (KCS revamp, Ascension etc.)
KCS revamp is still halted
RFEs for KCS revamp can be found here: https://docs.google.com/a/redhat.com/document/d/1HRZx_i_WEGp6WiwhokesQ0vFZ4RdUvigQjBdO1zGmRU/edit?usp=sharing 
Share knowledge by holding L&L and/or individual training sessions 
3 lightning talk sessions in 2016 (please check #Presentations)
Share knowledge by writing and/or updating and cleaning up KCSes 
Obtain and collect feedback (from customers, TAM, SRM, CSM, CSAT) for the good case work
Attend RH442 training
Identify key crucial skills together with one of the SME’s
3 hours - configuring and using c-scope (ask eel++) http://cscope.sourceforge.net/cscope_vim_tutorial.html 
2 hours - configuring and using git with RHEL Kernel repos (ask eel++)
Learn [sched] and [mm] (we need to make it trackable/measurable) 
As I  to these types of tickets, I guess a CQI on one of my tickets around this subject could be a nice starting point
