Hello Ben, my name is Gustavo and I follow you on youtube for some time.
I'm a Software Engineer working for SUSE and I want to design my own
Linux Desktop using off-the-shelve parts.

Thanks to your last video on driving a z80 using an arduino that I
finally visited your website and realized you are open to discuss
personal projects, so I decided to write you this email.

I made my mk-1 inspired by this:

    https://howchoo.com/g/zgmzytq1mmy/raspberry-pi-in-official-pi-keyboard

For mk-2, I want a raspberry pi 3 mode A+ to fit bellow the pi keyboard.

The idea is to discard the keyboard case and build a new CAD model which
can hold the keyboard components but also the pi 3A+. I also would like
to have:

    * Connect the keyboard usb directly to the pi3A+ USB-A port
        * Remove the pi3A+ USB-A port
        * Remove the keyboard microusb port
    * Add a power button
    * Add a hole under the case for easy sd card swap
    * Have an easy lock mechanism (no screws) to open the case
    * The case should fit a UK layout keyboard

Are you interested in building such a case for me and making a video
with instructions on how to build it?

I have a budget of 450US$ for this personal project.

Looking forward to hear an answer from you within 2 weeks.
