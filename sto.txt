Pat, Ingo, I've wrote the release notes for STO. Please feel free to change or
to request change. We should put it to the wild :D

Hi all, 

Ingo Weiss, Patrick Bajeneza and me, Gustavo Figueira, were working in a side 
project called "STO". 

  It was build to be plugable to SFDC and Ascension. 

STO is a template system for GSS Support, built for sharing. It is a browser 
extension which can be used with Ascension or SFDC. This extension connects to a
backend component to store the text files. After opening STO's main window
with the case opened in Ascension, just click on the template to insert it to
the comment area.

It was written in javascript/angular (web extension) and java (backend), and
the data is stored in text files.

The source code can be found here: link for the git repo (is the backend in
the same repo as the frontend?)

  #open-templates 

It gathers your rhn username from cookies to provision your account
automatically. After you create your templates, they are available for other 
users to view and copy.

"Sto" from Czech language means 100. STO will scale where repeatable customer 
behaviour occurs.

Why another template system? Originaly I thought of a system to share the
templates built-in in Ascension. This release notes is in fact a RFE for
Ascension :) What if each SBR could have a meta user, curated templates,
picked by SBR coaches, to help newcomers? 

Todo
 # Port extention to Firefox
 # Port to Ascension
 # v1.1 - scripting support
 # v2.0 - STO AI BOT - customer portal solving tickets :sunglasses:

Best regards,
Gustavo Figueira
