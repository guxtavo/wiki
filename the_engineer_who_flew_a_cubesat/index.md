A Raspberry Pi 3 could run in space for about 6 months (totally arbritary 
number). In order to minimize radiation effects, one would have to reboot it
every day, just to make sure there is no memory corruption. 

After shaking and baking the Pi, integrating the Flight software, testing the 
communications and sensors, I have no idea what's is necessary
