<h1>Chapter 4 - Maintaining Aircraft Control: Upset Prevention and Recovery Training.</h1>

<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p>A pilot’s fundamental responsibility is to prevent a loss
of control (LOC). Loss of control in-flight (LOC-I) is the
leading cause of fatal general aviation accidents in the U.S.
and commercial aviation worldwide. LOC-I is defined
as a significant deviation of an aircraft from the intended
flightpath and it often results from an airplane upset.
Maneuvering is the most common phase of flight for general
aviation LOC-I accidents to occur; however, LOC-I accidents
occur in all phases of flight.</p>

<p>To prevent LOC-I accidents, it is important for pilots to
recognize and maintain a heightened awareness of situations
that increase the risk of loss of control. Those situations
include: uncoordinated flight, equipment malfunctions,
pilot complacency, distraction, turbulence, and poor
risk management – like attempting to fly in instrument
meteorological conditions (IMC) when the pilot is not
qualified or proficient. Sadly, there are also LOC-I accidents
resulting from intentional disregard or recklessness.</p>

<p>To maintain aircraft control when faced with these or other
contributing factors, the pilot must be aware of situations where
LOC-I can occur, recognize when an airplane is approaching
a stall, has stalled, or is in an upset condition, and understand
and execute the correct procedures to recover the aircraft.</p>

<h2>Defining an Airplane Upset.</h2>

<p>The term “upset” was formally introduced by an industry
work group in 2004 in the “Pilot Guide to Airplane Upset
Recovery,” which is one part of the “Airplane Upset
Recovery Training Aid.” The working group was primarily
focused on large transport airplanes and sought to come up
with one term to describe an “unusual attitude” or “loss of
control,” for example, and to generally describe specific
parameters as part of its definition. Consistent with the Guide,
the FAA has defined an upset as an event that unintentionally
exceeds the parameters normally experienced in flight or
training. These parameters are:<p>

<ul>
<li>• Pitch attitude greater than 25°, nose up
<li>• Pitch attitude greater than 10°, nose down
<li>• Bank angle greater than 45°
<li>• Within the above parameters, but flying at airspeeds
inappropriate for the conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reference to inappropriate airspeeds describes a number
of undesired aircraft states, including stalls. However, stalls
are directly related to angle of attack (AOA), not airspeed.</p>

<p>To develop the crucial skills to prevent LOC-I, a pilot must
receive upset prevention and recovery training (UPRT), which
should include: slow flight, stalls, spins, and unusual attitudes.</p>

<p>Upset training has placed more focus on prevention—
understanding what can lead to an upset so a pilot does not
find himself or herself in such a situation. If an upset does
occur, however, upset training also reinforces proper recovery
techniques. A more detailed discussion of UPRT to include
its core concepts, what the training should include, and what
airplanes or kinds of simulation can be used for the training
can be found later in this chapter.</p>

<h2>Coordinated Flight.</h2>

<p>Coordinated flight occurs whenever the pilot is proactively
correcting for yaw effects associated with power (engine/
propeller effects), aileron inputs, how an airplane reacts when
turning, and airplane rigging. The airplane is in coordinated
flight when the airplane’s nose is yawed directly into the
relative wind and the ball is centered in the slip/skid indicator.</p>

<img src=4-1.png>

<p>A pilot should develop a sensitivity to side loads that indicate
the nose is not yawed into the relative wind, and the airplane is not slipping or skidding. A correction should be made by
applying rudder pressure on the side toward which one feels
a leaning sensation. This will be the same side to which the
ball in the slip/skid indicator has slewed (i.e., the old saying
“step on the ball”).</p>

<h2>Angle of Attack.</h2>

<p>The angle of attack (AOA) is the angle at which the chord of
the wing meets the relative wind. The chord is a straight line
from the leading edge to the trailing edge. At low angles of
attack, the airflow over the top of the wing flows smoothly
and produces lift with a relatively small amount of drag. As
the AOA increases, lift as well as drag increases; however,
above a wing’s critical AOA, the flow of air separates from
the upper surface and backfills, burbles and eddies, which
reduces lift and increases drag. This condition is a stall,
which can lead to loss of control if the AOA is not reduced.</p>

<p>It is important for the pilot to understand that a stall is the result
of exceeding the critical AOA, not of insufficient airspeed.
The term “stalling speed” can be misleading, as this speed is
often discussed when assuming 1G flight at a particular weight
and configuration. Increased load factor directly affects
stall speed (as well as do other factors such as gross weight,
center of gravity, and flap setting). Therefore, it is possible
to stall the wing at any airspeed, at any flight attitude, and at
any power setting. For example, if a pilot maintains airspeed
and rolls into a coordinated, level 60° banked turn, the load
factor is 2Gs, and the airplane will stall at a speed that is 40
percent higher than the straight-and-level stall speed. In that
2G level turn, the pilot has to increase AOA to increase the
lift required to maintain altitude. At this condition, the pilot
is closer to the critical AOA than during level flight and
therefore closer to the higher speed that the airplane will stall
at. Because “stalling speed” is not a constant number, pilots
must understand the underlying factors that affect it in order
to maintain aircraft control in all circumstances.</p>

<h2>Slow Flight.</h2>

<p>Slow flight is when the airplane AOA is just under the AOA
which will cause an aerodynamic buffet or a warning from a
stall warning device if equipped with one. A small increase in
AOA may result in an impending stall, which increases the risk
of an actual stall. In most normal flight operations the airplane
would not be flown close to the stall-warning AOA or critical
AOA, but because the airplane is flown at higher AOAs, and
thus reduced speeds in the takeoff/departure and approach/
landing phases of flight, learning to fly at reduced airspeeds is
essential. In these phases of flight, the airplane’s close proximity
to the ground would make loss of control catastrophic;
therefore, the pilot must be proficient in slow flight.</p>

<p>The objective of maneuvering in slow flight is to understand
the flight characteristics and how the airplane’s flight controls
feel near its aerodynamic buffet or stall-warning. It also
helps to develop the pilot’s recognition of how the airplane
feels, sounds, and looks when a stall is impending. These
characteristics include, degraded response to control inputs
and difficulty maintaining altitude. Practicing slow flight will
help pilots recognize an imminent stall not only from the feel
of the controls, but also from visual cues, aural indications,
and instrument indications.</p>

<p>For pilot training and testing purposes, slow flight includes
two main elements:</p>

<nl>
<li>1. Slowing to, maneuvering at, and recovering from
an airspeed at which the airplane is still capable of
maintaining controlled flight without activating the
stall warning—5 to 10 knots above the 1G stall speed
is a good target; and.</li>
<li>Performing slow flight in configurations appropriate
to takeoffs, climbs, descents, approaches to landing,
and go-arounds.</li>
<nl>

<p>Slow flight should be introduced with the airspeed
sufficiently above the stall to permit safe maneuvering, but
close enough to the stall warning for the pilot to experience
the characteristics of flight at a very low airspeed. One way
to determine the target airspeed is to slow the airplane to the
stall warning when in the desired slow flight configuration,
pitch the nose down slightly to eliminate the stall warning,
add power to maintain altitude and note the airspeed.</p>

<p>When practicing slow flight, a pilot learns to divide attention
between aircraft control and other demands. How the airplane
feels at the slower airspeeds aids the pilot in learning that
as airspeed decreases, control effectiveness decreases. For
instance, reducing airspeed from 30 knots to 20 knots above
the stalling speed will result in a certain loss of effectiveness
of flight control inputs because of less airflow over the
control surfaces. As airspeed is further reduced, the control
effectiveness is further reduced and the reduced airflow over
the control surfaces results in larger control movements
being required to create the same response. Pilots sometimes
refer to the feel of this reduced effectiveness as “sloppy” or
“mushy” controls.</p>

<p>When flying above minimum drag speed (L/D MAX ), even
a small increase in power will increase the speed of the
airplane. When flying at speeds below L/D MAX , also referred
to as flying on the back side of the power curve, larger
inputs in power or reducing the AOA will be required for
the airplane to be able to accelerate. Since slow flight will be
performed well below L/D MAX , the pilot must be aware that
large power inputs or a reduction in AOA will be required
to prevent the aircraft from decelerating. It is important to
note that when flying on the backside of the power curve,
as the AOA increases toward the critical AOA and the
airplane’s speed continues to decrease, small changes in
the pitch control result in disproportionally large changes in
induced drag and therefore changes in airspeed. As a result,
pitch becomes a more effective control of airspeed when
flying below L/D MAX and power is an effective control of
the altitude profile (i.e., climbs, descents, or level flight).</p>

<p>It is also important to note that an airplane flying below
L / D MAX , exhibits a characteristic known as “speed instability”
and the airspeed will continue to decay without appropriate
pilot action. For example, if the airplane is disturbed by
turbulence and the airspeed decreases, the airspeed may
continue to decrease without the appropriate pilot action of
reducing the AOA or adding power.</p>

<h2>Performing the Slow Flight Maneuver.</h2>

<p>Slow flight should be practiced in straight-and-level
flight, straight-ahead climbs and climbing medium-banked
(approximately 20 degrees) turns, and straight-ahead power-
off gliding descents and descending turns to represent the
takeoff and landing phases of flight. Slow flight training
should include slowing the airplane smoothly and promptly
from cruising to approach speeds without changes in altitude
or heading, and understanding the required power and
trim settings to maintain slow flight. It should also include
configuration changes, such as extending the landing gear
and adding flaps, while maintaining heading and altitude.
Slow flight in a single-engine airplane should be conducted
so the maneuver can be completed no lower than 1,500 feet
AGL, or higher, if recommended by the manufacturer. In
all cases, practicing slow flight should be conducted at an
adequate height above the ground for recovery should the
airplane inadvertently stall.</p>

<p>To begin the slow flight maneuver, clear the area and
gradually reduce thrust from cruise power and adjust the
pitch to allow the airspeed to decrease while maintaining
altitude. As the speed of the airplane decreases, note a change
in the sound of the airflow around the airplane. As the speed
approaches the target slow flight speed, which is an airspeed
just above the stall warning in the desired configuration
(i.e., approximately 5–10 knots above the stall speed for
that flight condition), additional power will be required to
maintain altitude. During these changing flight conditions, it
is important to trim the airplane to compensate for changes in
control pressures. If the airplane remains trimmed for cruising
speed (a lower AOA), strong aft (back) control pressure is
needed on the elevator, which makes precise control difficult
unless the airplane is retrimmed.</p>

<p>Slow flight is typically performed and evaluated in the
landing configuration. Therefore, both the landing gear
and the flaps should be extended to the landing position.
It is recommended the prescribed before-landing checks
be completed to configure the airplane. The extension of
gear and flaps typically occurs once cruise power has been
reduced and at appropriate airspeeds to ensure limitations
for extending those devices are not exceeded. Practicing this
maneuver in other configurations, such as a clean or takeoff
configuration, is also good training and may be evaluated
on the practical test.</p>

<p>With an AOA just under the AOA which may cause an
aerodynamic buffet or stall warning, the flight controls
are less effective. [Figure 4-3] The elevator control is less
responsive and larger control movements are necessary to
retain control of the airplane. In propeller-driven airplanes,
torque, slipstream effect, and P-factor may produce a strong
left yaw, which requires right rudder input to maintain
coordinated flight. The closer the airplane is to the 1G stall,
the greater the amount of right rudder pressure required.</p>

<h2>Maneuvering in Slow Flight.</h2>

<p>When the desired pitch attitude and airspeed have been
established in straight-and-level slow flight, the pilot must
maintain awareness of outside references and continually
cross-check the airplane’s instruments to maintain control.
The pilot should note the feel of the flight controls, especially
the airspeed changes caused by small pitch adjustments,
and the altitude changes caused by power changes. The
pilot should practice turns to determine the airplane’s
controllability characteristics at this low speed. During the
turns, it will be necessary to increase power to maintain
altitude. Abrupt or rough control movements during slow
flight may result in a stall. For instance, abruptly raising the
flaps while in slow flight can cause the plane to stall.
The pilot should also practice climbs and descents by
adjusting the power when stabilized in straight-and-level
slow flight. The pilot should note the increased yawing
tendency at high power settings and counter it with rudder
input as needed.</p>

<p>To exit the slow flight maneuver, follow the same procedure
as for recovery from a stall: apply forward control pressure
to reduce the AOA, maintain coordinated flight and level the
wings, and apply power as necessary to return to the desired
flightpath. As airspeed increases, clean up the airplane by
retracting flaps and landing gear if they were extended. A
pilot should anticipate the changes to the AOA as the landing
gear and flaps are retracted to avoid a stall.</p>

<p>Common errors in the performance of slow flight are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Failure to adequately clear the area.</li>
<li>Inadequate back-elevator pressure as power is reduced, resulting in altitude loss.</li>
<li>Excessive back-elevator pressure as power is reduced,
resulting in a climb followed by a rapid reduction in
airspeed.</li>
<li>Insufficient right rudder to compensate for left yaw.</li>
<li>Fixation on the flight instruments.</li>
<li>Failure to anticipate changes in AOA as flaps are
extended or retracted.</li>
<li>Inadequate power management.</li>
<li>Inability to adequately divide attention between
airplane control and orientation.</li>
<li>Failure to properly trim the airplane.</li>
<li>Failure to respond to a stall warning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stalls.</h2>

<p>A stall is an aerodynamic condition which occurs when
smooth airflow over the airplane’s wings is disrupted,
resulting in loss of lift. Specifically, a stall occurs when the
AOA—the angle between the chord line of the wing and the
relative wind—exceeds the wing’s critical AOA. It is possible
to exceed the critical AOA at any airspeed, at any attitude,
and at any power setting.</p>

<img src=4-4.png>

<p>For these reasons, it is important to understand factors and
situations that can lead to a stall, and develop proficiency in
stall recognition and recovery. Performing intentional stalls
will familiarize the pilot with the conditions that result in a
stall, assist in recognition of an impending stall, and develop
the proper corrective response if a stall occurs. Stalls are
practiced to two different levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>• Impending Stall—an impending stall occurs when the
AOA causes a stall warning, but has not yet reached
the critical AOA. Indications of an impending stall
can include buffeting, stick shaker, or aural warning.</li>
<li>• Full Stall—a full stall occurs when the critical AOA
is exceeded. Indications of a full stall are typically
that an uncommanded nose-down pitch cannot be
readily arrested, and this may be accompanied by an
uncommanded rolling motion. For airplanes equipped
with stick pushers, its activation is also a full stall
indication.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although it depends on the degree to which a stall has
progressed, some loss of altitude is expected during recovery.
The longer it takes for the pilot to recognize an impending
stall, the more likely it is that a full stall will result. Intentional
stalls should therefore be performed at an altitude that
provides adequate height above the ground for recovery and
return to normal level flight.</p>

<h2>Stall Recognition.</h2>

<p>A pilot must recognize the flight conditions that are
conducive to stalls and know how to apply the necessary
corrective action. This level of proficiency requires learning
to recognize an impending stall by sight, sound, and feel.</p>

<p>Stalls are usually accompanied by a continuous stall warning
for airplanes equipped with stall warning devices. These
devices may include an aural alert, lights, or a stick shaker
all which alert the pilot when approaching the critical AOA.
Certification standards permit manufacturers to provide
the required stall warning either through the inherent
aerodynamic qualities of the airplane or through a stall
warning device that gives a clear indication of the impending
stall. However, most vintage airplanes, and many types of
light sport and experimental airplanes, do not have stall
warning devices installed.<p>

<p>Other sensory cues for the pilot include:</p>


<ul>
<li>•
Feel—the pilot will feel control pressures change as
speed is reduced. With progressively less resistance on
the control surfaces, the pilot must use larger control
movements to get the desired airplane response. The
pilot will notice the airplane’s reaction time to control
movement increases. Just before the stall occurs,
buffeting, uncommanded rolling, or vibrations may
begin to occur.</li>
<li>Vision—since the airplane can be stalled in any
attitude, vision is not a foolproof indicator of
an impending stall. However, maintaining pitch
awareness is important.
• Hearing—as speed decreases, the pilot should notice
a change in sound made by the air flowing along the
airplane structure.
• Kinesthesia—the physical sensation (sometimes
referred to as “seat of the pants” sensations) of changes
in direction or speed is an important indicator to the
trained and experienced pilot in visual flight. If this
sensitivity is properly developed, it can warn the pilot
of an impending stall.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pilots in training must remember that a level-flight 1G stalling
speed is valid only:</p>

<ul>
<li>In unaccelerated 1G flight.</li>
<li>In coordinated flight (slip-skid indicator centered).</li>
<li>At one weight (typically maximum gross weight).</li>
<li>At a particular center of gravity (CG) (typically maximum forward CG).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Angle of Attack Indicators.</h2>

<p>Learning to recognize stalls without relying on stall warning
devices is important. However, airplanes can be equipped
with AOA indicators that can provide a visual indication of
the airplane’s proximity to the critical AOA. There are several
different kinds of AOA indicators with varying methods for
calculating AOA, therefore proper installation and training on
the use of these devices is important. AOA indicators measure
several parameters simultaneously, determine the current
AOA, and provide a visual image of the proximity to the critical
AOA. [Figure 4-5] Some AOA indicators also provide aural
indications, which can provide awareness to a change in AOA
that is trending towards the critical AOA prior to installed stall
warning systems. It’s important to note that some indicators
take flap position into consideration, but not all do.</p>

<p>Understanding what type of AOA indicator is installed on an
airplane, how the particular device determines AOA, what the
display is indicating and when the critical AOA is reached,
and what the appropriate response is to those indications
are all important components to AOA indicator training. It
is also encouraged to conduct in-flight training to see the
indications throughout various maneuvers, like slow flight,
stalls, takeoffs, and landings, and to practice the appropriate
responses to those indications. It is also important to note that
some items may limit the effectiveness of an AOA indicator
(e.g., calibration techniques, wing contamination, unheated
probes/vanes). Pilots flying an airplane equipped with an
AOA indicator should refer to the pilot handbook information
or contact the manufacturer for specific limitations applicable
to that indicator type.</p>

<h2>Stall Characteristics.</h2>

<p>Different airplane designs can result in different stall
characteristics. The pilot should know the stall characteristics
of the airplane being flown and the manufacturer’s
recommended recovery procedures. Factors that can affect
the stall characteristics of an airplane include its geometry,
CG, wing design, and high-lift devices. Engineering design
variations make it impossible to specifically describe the stall
characteristics for all airplanes; however, there are enough
similarities in small general aviation training-type airplanes
to offer broad guidelines.</p>

<p>Most training airplanes are designed so that the wings stall
progressively outward from the wing roots (where the wing
attaches to the fuselage) to the wingtips. Some wings are
manufactured with a certain amount of twist, known as
washout, resulting in the outboard portion of the wings having
a slightly lower AOA than the wing roots. This design feature
causes the wingtips to have a smaller AOA during flight than
the wing roots. Thus, the wing roots of an airplane exceed the
critical AOA before the wingtips, meaning the wing roots stall
first. Therefore, when the airplane is in a stalled condition,
the ailerons should still have a degree of control effectiveness
until/unless stalled airflow migrates outward along the wings.
Although airflow may still be attached at the wingtips, a
pilot should exercise caution using the ailerons prior to the
reduction of the AOA because it can exacerbate the stalled
condition. For example, if the airplane rolls left at the stall
(“rolls-off”), and the pilot applies right aileron to try to level
the wing, the downward-deflected aileron on the left wing
produces a greater AOA (and more induced drag), and a more
complete stall at the tip as the critical AOA is exceeded. This
can cause the wing to roll even more to the left, which is why
it is important to first reduce the AOA before attempting to
roll the airplane.</p>

<p>The pilot must also understand how the factors that affect
stalls are interrelated. In a power-off stall, for instance, the
cues (buffeting, shaking) are less noticeable than in the
power-on stall. In the power-off, 1G stall, the predominant
cue may be the elevator control position (full up elevator
against the stops) and a high descent rate.<p>

<h2>Fundamentals of Stall Recovery.</h2>

<p>Depending on the complexity of the airplane, stall recovery
could consist of as many as six steps. Even so, the pilot should
remember the most important action to an impending stall or
a full stall is to reduce the AOA. There have been numerous
situations where pilots did not first reduce AOA, and instead
prioritized power and maintaining altitude, which resulted
in a loss of control. This section provides a generic stall
recovery procedure for light general aviation aircraft adapted
from a template developed by major airplane manufacturers
and can be adjusted appropriately for the aircraft used.</p>

<img src=4-6.png>

<p>However, a pilot should always follow the
aircraft-specific manufacturer’s recommended procedures
if published and current.</p>

<p>The recovery actions should be made in a procedural manner;
they can be summarized in Figure 4-6. The following
discussion explains each of the six steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Disconnect the wing leveler or autopilot (if equipped).
Manual control is essential to recovery in all
situations. Disconnecting this equipment should be
done immediately and allow the pilot to move to the
next crucial step quickly. Leaving the wing leveler or
autopilot connected may result in inadvertent changes
or adjustments to the flight controls or trim that may
not be easily recognized or appropriate, especially
during high workload situations.</li>
<li>a) Pitch nose-down control. Reducing the AOA is
crucial for all stall recoveries. Push forward on the
flight controls to reduce the AOA below the critical
AOA until the impending stall indications are
eliminated before proceeding to the next step.
b) Trim nose-down pitch. If the elevator does not
provide the needed response, pitch trim may be
necessary. However, excessive use of pitch trim may
aggravate the condition, or may result in loss of control
or high structural loads.</li>
<li>Roll wings level. This orients the lift vector properly
for an effective recovery. It is important not to be
tempted to control the bank angle prior to reducing
AOA. Both roll stability and roll control will improve
considerably after getting the wings flying again. It is
also imperative for the pilot to proactively cancel yaw
with proper use of the rudder to prevent a stall from
progressing into a spin.</li>
<li>Add thrust/power. Power should be added as needed,
as stalls can occur at high power or low power settings,
or at high airspeeds or low airspeeds. Advance the
throttle promptly, but smoothly, as needed while
using rudder and elevator controls to stop any yawing
motion and prevent any undesirable pitching motion.
Adding power typically reduces the loss of altitude
during a stall recovery, but it does not eliminate a stall.
The reduction in AOA is imperative. For propeller-
driven airplanes, power application increases the
airflow around the wing, assisting in stall recovery.</li>
<li>Retract speedbrakes/spoilers (if equipped). This will
improve lift and the stall margin.</li>
<li>Return to the desired flightpath. Apply smooth and
coordinated flight control movements to return the
airplane to the desired flightpath being careful to
avoid a secondary stall. The pilot should, however, be
situationally aware of the proximity to terrain during
the recovery and take the necessary flight control
action to avoid contact with it.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above procedure can be adapted for the type of aircraft
flown. For example, a single-engine training airplane without
an autopilot would likely only use four of the six steps. The
first step is not needed therefore reduction of the AOA until
the stall warning is eliminated is first. Use of pitch trim is
less of a concern because most pilots can overpower the trim
in these airplanes and any mistrim can be corrected when
returning to the desired flightpath. The next step is rolling
the wings level followed by the addition of power as needed
all while maintaining coordinated flight. The airplane is not
equipped with speedbrakes or spoilers therefore this step can
be skipped and the recovery will conclude with returning to
the desired flightpath.</p>

<p>Similarly, a glider pilot does not have an autopilot therefore
the first step is the reduction of AOA until the stall warning
is eliminated. The pilot would then roll wings level while
maintaining coordinated flight. There is no power to add
therefore this step would not apply. Retracting speedbrakes
or spoilers would be the next step for a glider pilot followed
by returning to the desired flightpath.</p>

<h2>Stall Training.</h2>

<p>Practice in both power-on and power-off stalls is important
because it simulates stall conditions that could occur
during normal flight maneuvers. It is important for pilots to
understand the possible flight scenarios in which a stall could
occur. Stall accidents usually result from an inadvertent stall
at a low altitude, with the recovery not completed prior to
ground contact. For example, power-on stalls are practiced
to develop the pilot’s awareness of what could happen if
the airplane is pitched to an excessively nose-high attitude
immediately after takeoff, during a climbing turn, or when
trying to clear an obstacle. Power-off turning stalls develop
the pilot’s awareness of what could happen if the controls
are improperly used during a turn from the base leg to the
final approach. The power-off straight-ahead stall simulates
the stall that could occur when trying to stretch a glide after
the engine has failed, or if low on the approach to landing.</p>

<p>As in all maneuvers that involve significant changes in altitude
or direction, the pilot must ensure that the area is clear of other
air traffic at and below their altitude and that sufficient altitude
is available for a recovery before executing the maneuver. It is
recommended that stalls be practiced at an altitude that allows
recovery no lower than 1,500 feet AGL for single-engine
airplanes, or higher if recommended by the AFM/POH. Losing
altitude during recovery from a stall is to be expected.</p>

<h2>Approaches to Stalls (Impending Stalls), Power‐On
or Power-Off.</h2>

<p>An impending stall occurs when the airplane is approaching,
but does not exceed the critical AOA. The purpose of practicing
impending stalls is to learn to retain or regain full control of
the airplane immediately upon recognizing that it is nearing a
stall, or that a stall is likely to occur if the pilot does not take
appropriate action. Pilot training should emphasize teaching
the same recovery technique for impending stalls and full stalls.</p>

<p>The practice of impending stalls is of particular value in
developing the pilot’s sense of feel for executing maneuvers
in which maximum airplane performance is required. These
maneuvers require flight in which the airplane approaches
a stall, but the pilot initiates recovery at the first indication,
such as by a stall warning device activation.</p>

<p>Impending stalls may be entered and performed in the
same attitudes and configurations as the full stalls or other
maneuvers described in this chapter. However, instead of
allowing the airplane to reach the critical AOA, the pilot
must immediately reduce AOA once the stall warning
device goes off, if installed, or recognizes other cues such
as buffeting. Hold the nose down control input as required
to eliminate the stall warning. Then level the wings maintain
coordinated flight, and then apply whatever additional power
is necessary to return to the desired flightpath. The pilot
will have recovered once the airplane has returned to the
desired flightpath with sufficient airspeed and adequate flight
control effectiveness and no stall warning. Performance of
the impending stall maneuver is unsatisfactory if a full stall
occurs, if an excessively low pitch attitude is attained, or if the
pilot fails to take timely action to avoid excessive airspeed,
excessive loss of altitude, or a spin.</p>

<h2>Full Stalls, Power-Off.</h2>

<p>The practice of power-off stalls is usually performed with
normal landing approach conditions to simulate an accidental
stall occurring during approach to landing. However, power-
off stalls should be practiced at all flap settings to ensure
familiarity with handling arising from mechanical failures,
icing, or other abnormal situations. Airspeed in excess of
the normal approach speed should not be carried into a stall
entry since it could result in an abnormally nose-high attitude.</p>

<p>To set up the entry for a straight-ahead power-off stall,
airplanes equipped with flaps or retractable landing gear
should be in the landing configuration. After extending the
landing gear, applying carburetor heat (if applicable), and
retarding the throttle to idle (or normal approach power),
hold the airplane at a constant altitude in level flight until the
airspeed decelerates to normal approach speed. The airplane
should then be smoothly pitched down to a normal approach
attitude to maintain that airspeed. Wing flaps should be
extended and pitch attitude adjusted to maintain the airspeed.</p>

<p>When the approach attitude and airspeed have stabilized, the
pilot should smoothly raise the airplane’s nose to an attitude
that induces a stall. Directional control should be maintained
and wings held level by coordinated use of the ailerons and
rudder. Once the airplane reaches an attitude that will lead
to a stall, the pitch attitude is maintained with the elevator
until the stall occurs. The stall is recognized by the full-stall
cues previously described.<p>

<p>Recovery from the stall is accomplished by reducing the
AOA, applying as much nose-down control input as required
to eliminate the stall warning, leveling the wings, maintaining
coordinated flight, and then applying power as needed. Right
rudder pressure may be necessary to overcome the engine
torque effects as power is advanced and the nose is being
lowered. [Figure 4-7] If simulating an inadvertent stall on
approach to landing, the pilot should initiate a go-around
by establishing a positive rate of climb. Once in a climb,
the flaps and landing gear should be retracted as necessary.</p>

<p>Recovery from power-off stalls should also be practiced from
shallow banked turns to simulate an inadvertent stall during
a turn from base leg to final approach. During the practice
of these stalls, take care to ensure that the airplane remains
coordinated and the turn continues at a constant bank angle
until the full stall occurs. If the airplane is allowed to develop
a slip, the outer wing may stall first and move downward
abruptly. The recovery procedure is the same, regardless
of whether one wing rolls off first. The pilot must apply as
much nose down control input as necessary to eliminate the
stall warning, level the wings with ailerons, coordinate with
rudder, and add power as needed. In the practice of turning
stalls, no attempt should be made to stall or recover the
airplane on a predetermined heading. However, to simulate a
turn from base to final approach, the stall normally should be
made to occur within a heading change of approximately 90°.</p>

<h2>Full Stalls, Power-On.</h2>

<p>Power-on stall recoveries are practiced from straight climbs
and climbing turns (15° to 20° bank) to help the pilot recognize
the potential for an accidental stall during takeoff, go around,
climb, or when trying to clear an obstacle. Airplanes equipped
with flaps or retractable landing gear should normally be in
the takeoff configuration; however, power-on stalls should
also be practiced with the airplane in a clean configuration
(flaps and gear retracted) to ensure practice with all possible
takeoff and climb configurations. Power for practicing the
takeoff stall recovery should be maximum power, although
for some airplanes it may be reduced to a setting that will
prevent an excessively high pitch attitude.</p>

<p>To set up the entry for power-on stalls, establish the airplane
in the takeoff or climb configuration. Slow the airplane to
normal lift-off speed while continuing to clear the area of
other traffic. Upon reaching the desired speed, set takeoff
power or the recommended climb power for the power-on
stall (often referred to as a departure stall) while establishing a
climb attitude. The purpose of reducing the airspeed to lift-off
airspeed before the throttle is advanced to the recommended
setting is to avoid an excessively steep nose-up attitude for
a long period before the airplane stalls.</p>

<p>After establishing the climb attitude, smoothly raise the nose
to increase the AOA, and hold that attitude until the full stall
occurs. As described in connection with the stall characteristics
discussion, continual adjustments must be made to aileron
pressure, elevator pressure, and rudder pressure to maintain
coordinated flight while holding the attitude until the full stall
occurs. In most airplanes, as the airspeed decreases the pilot
must move the elevator control progressively further back
while simultaneously adding right rudder and maintaining
the climb attitude until reaching the full stall.</p>

<p>The pilot must promptly recognize when the stall has occurred
and take action to prevent a prolonged stalled condition. The
pilot should recover from the stall by immediately reducing
the AOA and applying as much nose-down control input as
required to eliminate the stall warning, level the wings with
ailerons, coordinate with rudder, and smoothly advance the
power as needed. Since the throttle is already at the climb
power setting, this step may simply mean confirming the
proper power setting.</p>

<img src=4-8.png>

<p>The final step is to return the airplane to the desired flightpath
(e.g., straight and level or departure/climb attitude). With
sufficient airspeed and control effectiveness, return the
throttle to the appropriate power setting.</p>

<h2>Secondary Stall.</h2>

<p>A secondary stall is so named because it occurs after recovery
from a preceding stall. It is typically caused by abrupt control
inputs or attempting to return to the desired flightpath too
quickly and the critical AOA is exceeded a second time. It
can also occur when the pilot does not sufficiently reduce
the AOA by lowering the pitch attitude or attempts to break
the stall by using power only.</p>

<img src=4-9.png>

<p>When a secondary stall occurs, the pilot should again perform
the stall recovery procedures by applying nose-down elevator
pressure as required to eliminate the stall warning, level
the wings with ailerons, coordinate with rudder, and adjust
power as needed. When the airplane is no longer in a stalled
condition the pilot can return the airplane to the desired
flightpath. For pilot certification, this is a demonstration-only
maneuver; only flight instructor applicants may be required
to perform it on a practical test.</p>

<h2>Accelerated Stalls.</h2>

<p>The objectives of demonstrating an accelerated stall are to
determine the stall characteristics of the airplane, experience
stalls at speeds greater than the +1G stall speed, and develop
the ability to instinctively recover at the onset of such stalls.
This is a maneuver only commercial pilot and flight instructor
applicants may be required to perform or demonstrate on a
practical test. However, all pilots should be familiar with the
situations that can cause an accelerated stall, how to recognize
it, and the appropriate recovery action should one occur.</p>

<p>At the same gross weight, airplane configuration, CG
location, power setting, and environmental conditions,
a given airplane consistently stalls at the same indicated
airspeed provided the airplane is at +1G (i.e., steady-state
unaccelerated flight). However, the airplane can also stall at
a higher indicated airspeed when the airplane is subject to an
acceleration greater than +1G, such as when turning, pulling
up, or other abrupt changes in flightpath. Stalls encountered
any time the G-load exceeds +1G are called “accelerated
maneuver stalls”. The accelerated stall would most frequently
occur inadvertently during improperly executed turns, stall
and spin recoveries, pullouts from steep dives, or when
overshooting a base to final turn. An accelerated stall is
typically demonstrated during steep turns.</p>

<p>A pilot should never practice accelerated stalls with wing
flaps in the extended position due to the lower design G-load
limitations in that configuration. Accelerated stalls should be
performed with a bank of approximately 45°, and in no case at
a speed greater than the airplane manufacturer’s recommended
airspeed or the specified design maneuvering speed (VA).</p>

<p>It is important to be familiar with V A , how it relates to
accelerated stalls, and how it changes depending on the
airplane’s weight. V A is the maximum speed at which the
maximum positive design load limit can be imposed either
by gusts or full one-sided deflection with one control surface
without causing structural damage. Performing accelerated
stalls at or below V A allows the airplane to reach the critical
AOA, which unloads the wing before it reaches the load
limit. At speeds above V A , the wing can reach the design load
limit at an AOA less than the critical AOA. This means it is
possible to damage the airplane before reaching the critical
AOA and an accelerated stall. Knowing what V A is for the
weight of the airplane being flown is critical to prevent
exceeding the load limit of the airplane during the maneuver.</p>

<p>There are two methods for performing an accelerated stall.
The most common accelerated stall procedure starts from
straight-and-level flight at an airspeed at or below V A .
Roll the airplane into a coordinated, level-flight 45° turn
and then smoothly, firmly, and progressively increase the
AOA through back elevator pressure until a stall occurs.
Alternatively, roll the airplane into a coordinated, level-
flight 45° turn at an airspeed above V A . After the airspeed
reaches V A , or at an airspeed 5 to 10 percent faster than the
unaccelerated stall speed, progressively increase the AOA
through back elevator pressure until a stall occurs. The
increased back elevator pressure increases the AOA, which
increases the lift and thus the G load. The G load pushes
the pilot’s body down in the seat. The increased lift also
increases drag, which may cause the airspeed to decrease.
It is recommended that you know the published stall speed
for 45° of bank, flaps up, before performing the maneuver.
This speed is typically published in the AFM.</p>

<p>An airplane typically stalls during a level, coordinated turn
similar to the way it does in wings level flight, except that
the stall buffet can be sharper. If the turn is coordinated at
the time of the stall, the airplane’s nose pitches away from
the pilot just as it does in a wings level stall since both wings
will tend to stall nearly simultaneously. If the airplane is not
properly coordinated at the time of stall, the stall behavior
may include a change in bank angle until the AOA has been
reduced. It is important to take recovery action at the first
indication of a stall (if impending stall training/checking) or
immediately after the stall has fully developed (if full stall
training/checking) by applying forward elevator pressure
as required to reduce the AOA and to eliminate the stall
warning, level the wings using ailerons, coordinate with
rudder, and adjust power as necessary. Stalls that result
from abrupt maneuvers tend to be more aggressive than
unaccelerated, +1G stalls. Because they occur at higher-
than-normal airspeeds or may occur at lower-than-anticipated
pitch attitudes, they can surprise an inexperienced pilot. A
prolonged accelerated stall should never be allowed. Failure
to take immediate steps toward recovery may result in a spin
or other departure from controlled flight.</p>

<h2>Cross-Control Stall.</h2>

<p>The objective of the cross-control stall demonstration is to
show the effects of uncoordinated flight on stall behavior
and to emphasize the importance of maintaining coordinated
flight while making turns. This is a demonstration-only
maneuver; only flight instructor applicants may be required
to perform it on a practical test. However, all pilots should
be familiar with the situations that can lead to a cross-control
stall, how to recognize it, and the appropriate recovery action
should one occur.</p>

<p>The aerodynamic effects of the uncoordinated, cross-control
stall can surprise the unwary pilot because it can occur with
very little warning and can be deadly if it occurs close to
the ground. The nose may pitch down, the bank angle may
suddenly change, and the airplane may continue to roll to an
inverted position, which is usually the beginning of a spin. It
is therefore essential for the pilot to follow the stall recovery
procedure by reducing the AOA until the stall warning has been
eliminated, then roll wings level using ailerons, and coordinate
with rudder inputs before the airplane enters a spiral or spin.</p>

<p>A cross-control stall occurs when the critical AOA is exceeded
with aileron pressure applied in one direction and rudder
pressure in the opposite direction, causing uncoordinated
flight. A skidding cross-control stall is most likely to occur
in the traffic pattern during a poorly planned and executed
base-to-final approach turn in which the airplane overshoots
the runway centerline and the pilot attempts to correct back
to centerline by increasing the bank angle, increasing back
elevator pressure, and applying rudder in the direction of the
turn (i.e., inside or bottom rudder pressure) to bring the nose
around further to align it with the runway. The difference
in lift between the inside and outside wing will increase,
resulting in an unwanted increase in bank angle. At the same
time, the nose of the airplane slices downward through the
horizon. The natural reaction to this may be for the pilot to
pull back on the elevator control, increasing the AOA toward
critical. Should a stall be encountered with these inputs, the
airplane may rapidly enter a spin. The safest action for an
“overshoot” is to perform a go-around. At the relatively low
altitude of a base-to-final approach turn, a pilot should be
reluctant to use angles of bank beyond 30 degrees to correct
back to runway centerline.</p>

<p>Before performing this stall, establish a safe altitude for entry
and recovery in the event of a spin, and clear the area of other
traffic while slowly retarding the throttle. The next step is to
lower the landing gear (if equipped with retractable gear),
close the throttle, and maintain altitude until the airspeed
approaches the normal glide speed. To avoid the possibility of
exceeding the airplane’s limitations, do not extend the flaps.
While the gliding attitude and airspeed are being established,
the airplane should be retrimmed. Once the glide is stabilized,
the airplane should be rolled into a medium-banked turn to
simulate a final approach turn that overshoots the centerline
of the runway.</p>

<p>During the turn, smoothly apply excessive rudder pressure
in the direction of the turn but hold the bank constant by
applying opposite aileron pressure. At the same time, increase
back elevator pressure to keep the nose from lowering. All of
these control pressures should be increased until the airplane
stalls. When the stall occurs, recover by applying nose-down
elevator pressure to reduce the AOA until the stall warning
has been eliminated, remove the excessive rudder input and
level the wings, and apply power as needed to return to the
desired flightpath.</p>

<h2>Elevator Trim Stall.</h2>

<p>The elevator trim stall demonstration shows what can happen
when the pilot applies full power for a go-around without
maintaining positive control of the airplane. [Figure 4-10] This
is a demonstration-only maneuver; only flight instructor
applicants may be required to perform it on a practical test.
However, all pilots should be familiar with the situations that
can cause an elevator trim stall, how to recognize it, and the
appropriate recovery action should one occur.</p>

<p>This situation may occur during a go-around procedure from
a normal landing approach or a simulated, forced-landing
approach, or immediately after a takeoff, with the trim set for
a normal landing approach glide at idle power. The objective
of the demonstration is to show the importance of making
smooth power applications, overcoming strong trim forces,
maintaining positive control of the airplane to hold safe flight
attitudes, and using proper and timely trim techniques. It
also develops the pilot’s ability to avoid actions that could
result in this stall, to recognize when an elevator trim stall is
approaching, and to take prompt and correct action to prevent
a full stall condition. It is imperative to avoid the occurrence
of an elevator trim stall during an actual go-around from an
approach to landing.</p>

<p>At a safe altitude and after ensuring that the area is clear of
other air traffic, the pilot should slowly retard the throttle
and extend the landing gear (if the airplane is equipped with
retractable gear). The next step is to extend the flaps to the
one-half or full position, close the throttle, and maintain
altitude until the airspeed approaches the normal glide speed.
When the normal glide is established, the pilot should trim
the airplane nose-up for the normal landing approach glide.
During this simulated final approach glide, the throttle is then
advanced smoothly to maximum allowable power, just as it
would be adjusted to perform a go-around.</p>

<p>The combined effects of increased propwash over the tail and
elevator trim tend to make the nose rise sharply and turn to the
left. With the throttle fully advanced, the pitch attitude increases
above the normal climbing attitude. When it is apparent the
airplane is approaching a stall, the pilot must apply sufficient
forward elevator pressure to reduce the AOA and eliminate
the stall warning before returning the airplane to the normal
climbing attitude. The pilot will need to adjust trim to relieve
the heavy control pressures and then complete the normal go-
around procedures and return to the desired flightpath. If taken
to the full stall, recovery will require a significant nose-down
attitude to reduce the AOA below its critical AOA, along with
a corresponding significant loss of altitude.</p>

<h2>Common Errors.</h2>

<p>Common errors in the performance of intentional stalls are:</p>

<ul>
<li>• Failure to adequately clear the area
• Over-reliance on the airspeed indicator and slip-skid
indicator while excluding other cues
• Inadvertent accelerated stall by pulling too fast on the
controls during a power-off or power on stall entry
• Inability to recognize an impending stall condition
• Failure to take timely action to prevent a full stall
during the conduct of impending stalls
• Failure to maintain a constant bank angle during
turning stalls
• Failure to maintain proper coordination with the rudder
throughout the stall and recovery
• Recovering before reaching the critical AOA when
practicing the full stall maneuver
• Not disconnecting the wing leveler or autopilot, if
equipped, prior to reducing AOA
• Recovery is attempted without recognizing the
importance of pitch control and AOA
• Not maintaining a nose down control input until the
stall warning is eliminated
• Pilot attempts to level the wings before reducing AOA
• Pilot attempts to recover with power before reducing
AOA
• Failure to roll wings level after AOA reduction and
stall warning is eliminated
• Inadvertent secondary stall during recovery
• Excessive forward-elevator pressure during recovery
resulting in low or negative G load
• Excessive airspeed buildup during recovery
• Losing situational awareness and failing to return to
desired flightpath or follow ATC instructions after
recovery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spin Awareness.</h2>

<p>A spin is an aggravated stall that typically occurs from a full
stall occurring with the airplane in a yawed state and results
in the airplane following a downward corkscrew path. As the
airplane rotates around a vertical axis, the outboard wing is less
stalled than the inboard wing, which creates a rolling, yawing,
and pitching motion. The airplane is basically descending
due to gravity, rolling, yawing, and pitching in a spiral path.
[Figure 4-11] The rotation results from an unequal AOA on the
airplane’s wings. The less-stalled rising wing has a decreasing
AOA, where the relative lift increases and the drag decreases.
Meanwhile, the descending wing has an increasing AOA,
which results in decreasing relative lift and increasing drag.</p>

<p>A spin occurs when the airplane’s wings exceed their critical
AOA (stall) with a sideslip or yaw acting on the airplane at, or
beyond, the actual stall. An airplane will yaw not only because
of incorrect rudder application but because of adverse yaw
created by aileron deflection; engine/prop effects, including
p-factor, torque, spiraling slipstream, and gyroscopic
precession; and wind shear, including wake turbulence. If
the yaw had been created by the pilot because of incorrect
rudder use, the pilot may not be aware that a critical AOA has
been exceeded until the airplane yaws out of control toward
the lowering wing. A stall that occurs while the airplane is
in a slipping or skidding turn can result in a spin entry and
rotation in the direction of rudder application, regardless of
which wingtip is raised. If the pilot does not immediately
initiate stall recovery, the airplane may enter a spin.</p>

<p>Maintaining directional control and not allowing the nose to
yaw before stall recovery is initiated is key to averting a spin.
The pilot must apply the correct amount of rudder to keep the
nose from yawing and the wings from banking.
Modern airplanes tend to be more reluctant to spin compared
to older designs, however it is not impossible for them to
spin. Mishandling the controls in turns, stalls, and flight
at minimum controllable airspeeds can put even the most
reluctant airplanes into an accidental spin. Proficiency in
avoiding conditions that could lead to an accidental stall/spin
situation, and in promptly taking the correct actions to recover
to normal flight, is essential. An airplane must be stalled and
yawed in order to enter a spin; therefore, continued practice in
stall recognition and recovery helps the pilot develop a more
instinctive and prompt reaction in recognizing an approaching
spin. Upon recognition of a spin or approaching spin, the
pilot should immediately execute spin recovery procedures.</p>

<h2>Spin Procedures.</h2>

<p>The first rule for spin demonstration is to ensure that the
airplane is approved for spins. Please note that this discussion
addresses generic spin procedures; it does not cover special
spin procedures or techniques required for a particular
airplane. Safety dictates careful review of the AFM/POH
and regulations before attempting spins in any airplane. The
review should include the following items:</p>

<ul>
<li>• The airplane’s AFM/POH limitations section,
placards, or type certification data to determine if the
airplane is approved for spins
• Weight and balance limitations
• Recommended entry and recovery procedures
• The current 14 CFR Part 91 parachute requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also essential is a thorough airplane preflight inspection, with
special emphasis on excess or loose items that may affect the
weight, center of gravity, and controllability of the airplane.
It is also important to ensure that the airplane is within any
CG limitations as determined by the manufacturer. Slack
or loose control cables (particularly rudder and elevator)
could prevent full anti-spin control deflections and delay or
preclude recovery in some airplanes.</p>

<p>Prior to beginning spin training, clear the flight area above
and below the airplane for other traffic. This task may be
accomplished while slowing the airplane for the spin entry.
In addition, all spin training should be initiated at an altitude
high enough to complete recovery at or above 1,500 feet AGL.
It may be appropriate to introduce spin training by first
practicing both power-on and power-off stalls in a clean
configuration. This practice helps familiarize the pilot with
the airplane’s specific stall and recovery characteristics. In all
phases of training, the pilot should take care with handling of
the power (throttle), and apply carburetor heat, if equipped,
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>

<p>There are four phases of a spin: entry, incipient, developed,
and recovery.</p>

<img src=4-12.png>

<h3>Entry Phase.</h3>

<p>In the entry phase, the pilot intentionally or accidentally
provides the necessary elements for the spin. The entry
procedure for demonstrating a spin is similar to a power-off
stall. During the entry, the pilot should slowly reduce power to
idle, while simultaneously raising the nose to a pitch attitude
that ensures a stall. As the airplane approaches a stall, smoothly
apply full rudder in the direction of the desired spin rotation
while applying full back (up) elevator to the limit of travel.
Always maintain the ailerons in the neutral position during
the spin procedure unless AFM/POH specifies otherwise.</p>

<h3>Incipient Phase.</h3>

<p>The incipient phase occurs from the time the airplane stalls
and starts rotating until the spin has fully developed. This
phase may take two to four turns for most airplanes. In this
phase, the aerodynamic and inertial forces have not achieved
a balance. As the incipient phase develops, the indicated
airspeed will generally stabilize at a low and constant airspeed
and the symbolic airplane of the turn indicator should indicate
the direction of the spin. The slip/skid ball is unreliable when
spinning.</p>

<p>The pilot should initiate incipient spin recovery procedures
prior to completing 360° of rotation. The pilot should apply
full rudder opposite the direction of rotation. The turn
indicator shows a deflection in the direction of rotation if
disoriented.</p>

<p>Incipient spins that are not allowed to develop into a steady-
state spin are the most commonly used maneuver in initial
spin training and recovery techniques.<p>

<h3>Developed Phase.</h3>

<p>The developed phase occurs when the airplane’s angular
rotation rate, airspeed, and vertical speed are stabilized in
a flightpath that is nearly vertical. In the developed phase,
aerodynamic forces and inertial forces are in balance, and
the airplane’s attitude, angles, and self-sustaining motions
about the vertical axis are constant or repetitive, or nearly so.
The spin is in equilibrium. It is important to note that some
training airplanes will not enter into the developed phase
but could transition unexpectedly from the incipient phase
into a spiral dive. In a spiral dive the airplane will not be in
equilibrium but instead will be accelerating and G load can
rapidly increase as a result.</p>

<h3>Recovery Phase.</h3>

<p>The recovery phase occurs when rotation ceases and the AOA
of the wings is decreased below the critical AOA. This phase
may last for as little as a quarter turn or up to several turns
depending upon the airplane and the type of spin.</p>

<p>To recover, the pilot applies control inputs to disrupt the
spin equilibrium by stopping the rotation and unstalling
the wing. To accomplish spin recovery, always follow the
manufacturer’s recommended procedures. In the absence of
the manufacturer’s recommended spin recovery procedures
and techniques, use the spin recovery procedures in
Figure 4-13. If the flaps and/or retractable landing gear are
extended prior to the spin, they should be retracted as soon
as practicable after spin entry.</p>

<ol>
<li>Reduce the Power (Throttle) to Idle.</li>
<li>Position the Ailerons to Neutral.</li>
<li>Apply Full Opposite Rudder against the Rotation.</li>
<li>Apply Positive, Brisk, and Straight Forward Elevator (Forward of Neutral).</li>
<li>Neutralize the Rudder After Spin Rotation Stops.</li>
<li>Apply Back Elevator Pressure to Return to Level Flight.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following discussion explains each of the six steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reduce the Power (Throttle) to Idle. Power aggravates
spin characteristics. It can result in a flatter spin
attitude and usually increases the rate of rotation.
<li>Position the Ailerons to Neutral. Ailerons may have
an adverse effect on spin recovery. Aileron control
in the direction of the spin may accelerate the rate
of rotation, steepen the spin attitude and delay the
recovery. Aileron control opposite the direction of
the spin may cause flattening of the spin attitude and
delayed recovery; or may even be responsible for
causing an unrecoverable spin. The best procedure is
to ensure that the ailerons are neutral.</li>
<li>Apply Full Opposite Rudder against the Rotation.
Apply and hold full opposite rudder until rotation
stops. Rudder tends to be the most important control
for recovery in typical, single-engine airplanes, and
its application should be brisk and full opposite to the
direction of rotation. Avoid slow and overly cautious
opposite rudder movement during spin recovery,
which can allow the airplane to spin indefinitely, even
with anti-spin inputs. A brisk and positive technique
results in a more positive spin recovery.</li>
<li>Apply Positive, Brisk, and Straight Forward Elevator
(Forward of Neutral). This step should be taken
immediately after full rudder application. Do not wait
for the rotation to stop before performing this step.
The forceful movement of the elevator decreases the
AOA and drives the airplane toward unstalled flight. In
some cases, full forward elevator may be required for
recovery. Hold the controls firmly in these positions
until the spinning stops. (Note: If the airspeed is
increasing, the airplane is no longer in a spin. In a
spin, the airplane is stalled, and the indicated airspeed
should therefore be relatively low and constant and
not be accelerating.)</li>
<li>Neutralize the Rudder After Spin Rotation Stops.
Failure to neutralize the rudder at this time, when
airspeed is increasing, causes a yawing or sideslipping
effect.</li>
<li>Apply Back Elevator Pressure to Return to Level
Flight. Be careful not to apply excessive back elevator
pressure after the rotation stops and the rudder has
been neutralized. Excessive back elevator pressure
can cause a secondary stall and may result in another
spin. The pilot must also avoid exceeding the G-load
limits and airspeed limitations during the pull out.</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, it is important to remember that the spin recovery
procedures and techniques described above are recommended
for use only in the absence of the manufacturer’s procedures.
The pilot must always be familiar with the manufacturer’s
procedures for spin recovery.</p>

<h3>Intentional Spins.</h3>

<p>If the manufacturer does not specifically approve an airplane
for spins, intentional spins are not authorized by the CFRs
or by this handbook. The official sources for determining
whether the spin maneuver is approved are:</p>

<ul>
<li>• Type Certificate Data Sheets or the Aircraft
Specifications
<li>• The limitation section of the FAA-approved AFM/
POH. The limitation section may provide additional
specific requirements for spin authorization, such as
limiting gross weight, CG range, and amount of fuel.
<li>• On a placard located in clear view of the pilot in the
airplane (e.g., “NO ACROBATIC MANEUVERS
INCLUDING SPINS APPROVED”). In airplanes
placarded against spins, there is no assurance that
recovery from a fully developed spin is possible.</li>
</ul>
