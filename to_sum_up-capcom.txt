DESCRIPTION
       At 16 I started my first job as  web designer.  It was the modem times.
       I continued using  notepad in a different company to write my html, and
       for the first  time  there was network! I  had a  brief  stay in an ISP
       before starting my  Unix ramp-up. The network  was huge and I got first
       taste  with  routing   and  switching.  There  I  worked  most  of  the
       infrastructure  disciplines . It  was good 4 years. Then  I went  to an
      ISP to manage the network and 100+ devices. I was also lead on a captive
      portal system  development. Then I did quick projects involving Unix and
       Storage,  before  I  move to a pharmaceutical  company managing    400+
       devices and doing sap basis support. In telcos I was integrating  high-
       throughput  SMS  gateways in  complex and mission-critical networks. In
       Red Hat  I got more in depth with kernel and x86_64, and was supporting
      different types or work-load, in all sectors. Now at SuSE I`m delivering
       packages, helping  support engineers with difficult problems, improving
       my developer skills and getting familiar with kubernetes.

       As a Linux Developer in SUSE, I am a brigde between the support and the
       maintainer. The job involves dealing with the CICD (OBS and internal
       tools plugued to OBS).
