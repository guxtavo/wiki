DESCRIPTION
       At 16 I started my first job as web designer. It was the modem times.
       I continued using notepad in a different company to write my html, and
       for the first time there was network! I had a breif stay in an ISP
       before starting my Unix ramp-up. The network was huge and I got first 
       taste with routing and switching. There I worked all the infrastructure
       disciplenes you can think of. It was good 4 years. Then I went to an
       ISP to manage the network and 50+ servers. I was also lead on a captive
       portal system. Then I did quick projects involving Unix and Storage, 
       before I move to a pharmaciutical company managing network plus 70+ 
       servers. In telco I was integrating high-throughput SMS gateways in 
       complex and mission-critical networks. In Red Hat it was kernel time, 
       sched and mm took my attention for almost three years, and now at SuSE
       I work as Linux Developer on packaging.
