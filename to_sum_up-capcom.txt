DESCRIPTION
       At 16 I started my  first job as  web designer.  It was the modem times.
       I continued using  notepad in a  different company to write my html, and
       for the first  time  there was  network! I  had a  brief  stay in an ISP
       before starting my  Unix ramp-up. The  network  was huge and I got first 
       taste  with  routing   and  switching.  There   I  worked  most  of  the 
       infrastructure  disciplines . It  was  good 4 years. Then  I went  to an
       ISP to  manage the network and 50+ servers. I was also lead on a captive
       portal system  development. Then I did quick projects involving Unix and 
       Storage,  before  I  move to a  pharmaceutical  company managing network 
       plus  70+ servers  (including a brief try as SAP Basis). In telcos I was 
       integrating high-throughput SMS gateways in complex and mission-critical
       networks. In Red Hat it was  kernel time, sched and mm took my attention 
       for   almost three years, and now at   SuSE I work as Linux Developer on 
       packaging, developing my C and Storage skills, to become full stack dev.
