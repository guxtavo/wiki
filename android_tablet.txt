I recently got for 80 euros a new Android tablet, and here I will describe my
experience so far. Let's start with the specs:

  * Quad-core Cortex A53 at 1.3 GHz (40 seconds boot time) 
  * 1GB RAM, 16GB storage (11GB available to user)
  * 3450mA battery (~6 hours of screen time)
  * Android 5.0.1

After Booting the first time and setting up my account, it immediately tells
me there is a new "firmware" update. I got a little nervous as after install
around 20MB worth of updates, it took the system some minutes to boot. I
thought I've bricked it somehow. The second firmware was rolled after the first
one, but this time I just waited the window manager to appear.

Now to my use case. I will consume media and text, on the 7" screen, which is
an acceptable size for 1024*600 resolution. I'm very fond of the Google 
ecosystem, and the media consumption will be mainly in these apps:
  * Play Music
  * YouTube
  * Facebook (Lite)
  * Google+
  * Reddit
  * Imgur
  * Audible

Besides media, I will rock my books on Google Books. The reader has solid 
features, which satisfy my needs:
  * Translation and dictionary
  * Text to speech
  * Bookmarks and notes
  * Dark theme and Night Light

As my PIM system, I will also use:
  * Calendar
  * Clock 
  * Keep
  * Translate

Finishing up with the Internet basics:
  * Inbox
  * Chrome

IM is not something I will do on this device, which I will keep in my phone
only.

Annoying things
  * Screen lock wallpaper cannot be set from your gallery, and there is a
    limited number of them in this firmware
  * Mcafee, Lenovo and other bloatware apps came pre-installed, some cannot be
    disabled
  * No fast charging

The Android 5 experience is pretty consistent, even for an Android 7.1 user.
Version 5.0 has around 10% of the user base and 5.X is running on 33% of all
devices according to Android Developer's Dashboard. As long as app developers
don't decide to support only latter versions and version 5.X has a big chunk
of the market, this tablet will still be useful (2-5 years perhaps).

It is a budget tablet, but the overall experience is satisfactory. There is
noticeable stutter everywhere, but this is expected in such low specs. Still
this is a gadget most people in poor countries couldn't afford. It would be a
very satisfactory device to own if I couldn't afford any other device. In
times where high-end phones are shipping with 6GB of RAM, this budget device
does the job with a GB of memory and still has some memory free.

There is a cheaper version with 8GB of storage, but since the internal storage
is used by Android's system, there would be not enough space to comfortably
download all the media. Hopefully someday, manufactures will be able to sell
such a fair device for less than 50 euros, I hope.

Mali-T760 MP2 
The GPU Mali-T760 MP2 runs at 500 million cycles per second, and the DDR3
memory bus does up to 5.3GB/s and can store 512KB in L2 cache
@ 500 MHz

The GPU ASIC die size is at 28nm in the 1 shader, and 14nm on the 16 cores (I
couldn't find power consumption information).
