# Objectives

    * Allow programming students to build an affordable computer system
      with off-the-shelve parts
    * 3D design a under-case for the rpi official keyboard
    * Flexibility


# mk-1

mk-1 is a rpi official keyboard with a rpi zero w inside it:

# mk-2

For mk2 I will try to fit a rpi4 inside the official rpi keyboard.

I will reproduce in 3D the bottom of the rpi official keyboard case and
then change it to allow fitting a rpi0w and a pi4.

    * how to fit a raspberry pi 4 inside the raspberry pi keyboard
      * make a 3d copy of the bottom of the rpi keyboard
      * alter the design to be taller in order to fit the pi 4
    * install power button on mk2

# mk-3

Build a version which can fit 3 rpi0w inside the keyboard.

# LED

The capslock led can be used to relay information to the user. Currently
it is used for the screencast script (brink 3 times to warn the user the
screencast has started/stopped.

My idea is to use the leds script when the wait time is higher than 30%.
