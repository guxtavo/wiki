Pat, Ingo, I've written the release notes for STO. Please feel free to change or
to request change. We should put it into the wild :D

Hi all, 

Ingo Weiss, Patrick Bajeneza and me, Gustavo Figueira, were working in a side 
project called "STO". 

  It was build to be plugable to SFDC and Ascension. 

STO is a template system for GSS Support, built for sharing. It is a browser 
extension which can be used with Ascension or SFDC. The extension connects to a
backend component to store the text files. After opening STO's main window
with the case opened in Ascension, just click on the template to insert it to
the comment area.

STO is written in javascript/angular (browser extension) and java (backend), and
the data is stored in text files. Other features include:

  * template editor
  * rhn username search
  * chrooted backend
  * simple rest api
  * 

The source code can be found here:
                         https://gitlabs.redhat.com/pbajanez/sto.git
                         https://backend git repo 

  #open-templates 

STO gathers your rhn username from CP cookie to provision your account
automatically. After you create your templates, they are available for other 
users to view and copy.

"Sto" from Czech language means 100. STO will scale where repeatable customer 
behaviour occurs.

  #ascension-rfe

What if each SBR had a meta user, with curated templates, picked by SBR
coaches, and senior members, to help newcomers? 

Todo
 * Port extention to Firefox || Port to Ascension
 * v1.1 - scripting support
 * v2.0 - STO AI BOT - customer portal solving tickets
