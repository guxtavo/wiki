Hi all, 

Ingo Weiss, Patrick Bajeneza and me, Gustavo Figueira, were working in a side 
project called "STO". 

  Sto (Czech), 100 (číslo), one hundred.

STO is a template system for GSS Support, built for sharing. It is a browser 
extension which can be used with Ascension or SFDC. The extension connects to a
back-end component which stores the templates. After opening STO's main window
with the case opened in Ascension, just click on the template to insert it to
the comment area.

            Image 1 - main interface 

STO is written in JavaScript/Angular (browser extension) and Java (back-end).
Other features include:

  * Template editor
  * RHN username search
  * Rest API

The source code can be found here:
                         https://gitlabs.redhat.com/pbajanez/sto.git
                         https://backend git repo 

  #open-templates 

STO gathers your RHN username from CP cookies to provision your account
automatically. After you create your templates, they are available for other 
users to view and copy.

  #ascension-rfe

STO will scale where repeatable customer behavior occurs. After SBR coaches
and senior members curate templates for a meta user, a Weak AI system 
can be fed by the rest API to compose responses to customers. 

Todo
 * Port extension to Firefox || Port to Ascension
