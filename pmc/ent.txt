 ent -> django website
   ent: the client -> post jobs
   expert: works on jobs

   Modules:
    * project management (worflow)
    * bidding
    * payment

Every job is processed by the CliNic before it is posted for bidding. "Nic"
selects free experts and after the client selects the bid, work can start.

These are the types of experts:

    * Project Manager
    * Product Manager
    * Service Manager
    * Delivery Manager
    * Developer
    * Support
    * QA

Each type has 3 levels
The PM type is mandatory for all projects.

Jobs can be of the following types:

    * Request
    * Question
    * Coaching
    * Fix

The PM must break down the tasks into chunks that can be executed within 25
minutes (1 pomodoro)

Each task can then enter the bid process to select an expert (unless one was
already selected in the task creation).

Experts have 3 days to deliver the work, upon which the PM and Client will
review and rate. It is an interative process, as the Project advances, more
tasks and bids will help you progress until completion (or "checkpoint" in
case you have an ongoing project).

Experts can request an invitation.

Service fee: We take 5% after taxes and fees.

There are no returns (when you work for a company and something goes wrong
they don't ask you to return part of your salary).
