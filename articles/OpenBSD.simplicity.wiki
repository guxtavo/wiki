I recently acquired an OpenBSD book and am running as my daily driver in SuSE.

Things are different in the BSD world, so instead of Googling I try to read the man pages. 

# Start your investigation making quieting the top

   top(8)

     -q      Renice top to -20 so that it will run faster.  This can be used
             when the system is being very sluggish to improve the possibility
             of discovering the problem.  This option can only be used by
             root.

# Controlled vmcore descend, good habits with shutdown

shutdown(8) - first option

     -d      When used with -h, -p, or -r causes system to perform a dump.
             This option is useful for debugging system dump procedures or
             capturing the state of a corrupted or misbehaving system.  See
             savecore(8) for information on how to recover this dump.
