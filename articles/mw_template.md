 MOP title: Security patches installation Dec-06

 MOP purpose:

    - we will have a software update (including security patches) for
      Nuremberg and Prague Netapp systems, which may lead to some NFS
      clients reconnects

    - leftovers from last weeks, a few servers that still need the
      latest kernel patch.
