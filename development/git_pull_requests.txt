I always have difficulties with fetching a commit from a github pull request
which was merged.

Take pull 334 as an example. The code I want is here:

https://github.com/kubic-project/salt/commit/932ec2730b571361325da7ccaf5d0eca3b9cd821
git clone...
[~]$ cd git/salt/
[salt]$ git show 932ec2730b571361325da7ccaf5d0eca3b9cd821
fatal: bad object 932ec2730b571361325da7ccaf5d0eca3b9cd821

bad object? what about the shorter id:

[salt]$ git show 932ec27
fatal: ambiguous argument '932ec27': unknown revision or path not in the
working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'


Ok, I now understand:

inercia merged 1 commit into release-2.0 from release-2.0-fix-rolebindings 9
days ago

I need to checkout release-2.0.

git checkout release-2.0
git log


git show
commit 24ca2193945abc5b3f4af2b7b77ed5db59ffa0a5 (HEAD -> release-2.0,
origin/release-2.0)

    Do not try to create clusterrolebindings when they are already there

    bsc#1072005

Lessons learned:
  * check the second line of the commit, it should tell you "into <branch>"
  * checkout the branch and use git log -p to see the diff wih code
