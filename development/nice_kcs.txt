  Load average is higher or more sporadic after updating to kernel-2.6.32-573.22.1.el6 
  https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2253721

  2.6.32-504 up to and including 2.6.32-504.12.2
  Upgrading to RHEL 6.6, 7.0 or 7.1 may result in an application, using futexes, appearing to stall in futex_wait()

  System becomes unresponsive with message "INFO: task <process>:<pid> blocked for more than 120 seconds".
  https://access.redhat.com/solutions/31453

  What is the hung task watchdog?
  https://access.redhat.com/articles/1353393

  "At various times during a process's lifecycle it will stop while it waits
  for an event to occur and cannot proceed until that event happens. If for
  some reason the event does not occur within a reasonable timeframe the
  process may experience some undesirable delays. The kernel hung task
  watchdog is designed to detect these cases and report them to the system log
  and optionally panic the system."
