 == Prerequisites ==

 1. Batch data set 
 2. Automation in place to run batches and capture required data
 3. Data diagram




 == Timeline ==

   Action                                             Needed time 
   1. yum update kernel  (install newest kernel)      5-15 minutes
   2. init 6 (reboot the system)                      5-15 minutes
   3. Test application                                
   4. Rollback procedure (if needed)                  5-15 minutes

 == Rollback procedure ==

 1. How do I boot using an alternate / previous / older kernel?
