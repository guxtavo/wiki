To: two guys working on automation

Michal Rdest, my GSS mmanager, told me about your bot, and I've decided to
write a compilation of templates for the most common kernel cases I have
stomped, and still do, in the hopes this is used in your bot. 

== Automation for all cases ==

  Trigger: New cases

  Action: Public comment

Thanks for opening a ticket with us. This is an automated message, and you
might receive more if our filters can identify acurately the main traits of
your inquiry. If this is the first time you contact us or is unsure how to
better help us, you might want to start with this link:

In case you are unsure how to provide large files to our support team, here
you can find how:

  large sosreports, heap dumps, large log files, etc.)

If you don't know why your system is behaving in an unexpected way, we can
have a look at the "snapshot" of the system state, sosreport - which  Collect
and package diagnostic and support data:

           if "performance" keyword is used

  Action: 1) Attach file to case
          > plotted sar telemetry to ticket (today, last 7 days) using
            asap-graph

          2) Public comment 

Our filters detected you have a question about performance. We have plotted
the system telemetry from the day the sosreport was generated and from the
last week.

== Automation for vmcore cases ==

  Trigger: vmcore is attached, for each

  Action: 1) dispatch job to optimus using retrace-tool

          2) Private comment - retrace id

== Automation for cannot boot cases ==

  Trigger: if keyword "boot" is used

  Action: Public comment

Our filters have detected you cannot boot your system. 

The most appropriate option is to boot in rescue mode to either collect data
or troubleshoot the issue:

== Automation for hang systems ==

Our filters detected your system was either hung or had a crash/restart
