What I've learned using openSUSE Tumbleweed for amost two months

After 3+ years using Fedora (From 19 until 25), I got to try Tumbleweed, and
with the new Night Light[1] patch on Gnome 3.24, I've decided to write a small 
article showing what I like about this rolling release.

I don't need a window manager as I'm a CLI guy, and my terminal manager is 
tmux(1). Tumbleweed's man package has a neat feature for developers, it always 
hint you about Posix programmer's manual page when you call man program:

	[~]$ man at
	 * at (1)
	   at (1p)
	Man: What manual page do you want?

Not all programs have the Posix programmer's manual page.

zypper

Zypper does the job, and I didn't have to toy with it so much, but one neat 
thing about it is that the confirmation question has the default answer yes,
so after issuing a command, you only need to hit enter one more time to confirm
the operation. It riminds me of a scene from Deadpool movie:

	- Maximum effort!

Boot screen

The grub menu has a nice organization. Instead of showing you all kernels at
once, it shows you the kernel categories. The first item of course is 
tumbleweed. This is the default kernel. If you still want to select the kernel
version, there is another option for that

boot and take notes from grub screen
