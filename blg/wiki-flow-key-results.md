Project Management is about calendar appointments

To finish something, first you need to create milestones for your OKRs.

Once those are set you need to figure out when they will happen. That's

There is a natural tendency for types like me to avoid scheduling time
to do some task. It is clear that there are so many things one can do
and this creates a psychological pressure. So we end up not scheduling
many things and trying to concentrate on consistency. You can always
become more consistent, but that doesn't change the fact that a great
number of tasks are still left to be scheduled.

What flow.cli should be is a way of verifying that we have objectives
and key results.
