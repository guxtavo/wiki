There are 4 states in "network connectivity" which most of us working
will find ourselves in:

  - connectivity to your router  (e.g.: able to ping it)
  - connectivity to the internet (e.g.: able to ping 8.8.8.8)
  - query reponse from DNS       (e.g.: able to resolve FQDNs)
  - connectivity to the VPN      (e.g.: able to ping vpn ips)


Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than _right_ now.
