Tuna code review
Git repo: "git clone https://git.fedorahosted.org/git/tuna.git"

I was reviewing the python code from tuna and found the following:

  35 # FIXME: ETOOMANYGLOBALS, we need a class!

Initially I thought in creating at least 3 classes, TunaCPU, TunaIRQs and
TunaNIC, as there are at least 3 functions for each group of commands.

I ended up deciding to:

  - create class TunaClass - I need to change this name
  - move global variables ps, nr_cpus, irqs and nics to TunaClass
  - move all functions to TunaClass
  - instantiate TunaClass.method instead of function() in the rest of the code
  - keep functions usage(), list_config(), apply_config, i18n_init, pick_op
    outside of the Class as they do not handle with global variables. 

Next steps

  - need to investigate the need of self inside methods' params, but as the
    methods are being called "stand-alone", this might not be necessary.
  - test the code
