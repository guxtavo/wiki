I started trying to understand a CGI script. I was a one man IT in a small
realstate, adding up tasks like, helpdesk, web designing, lan administration
(there were a transition from dumb terminals to i386 desktops once I joined),
but normally the coding was outsourced, including this CGI on one of the
domains I used to administer. 

I then went to a one month on an ISP where I tried to build a web store in PHP
and MySQL, which I rapidily left for Unix administration Job as I saw I was
not able to tackle the project. 

There were several books in this Unix Admin job, and I eventually read
"Digitail Unix User Guide" and a Cyclades booklet about TCP/IP. They were the
first IT books I've read. And it was at this job that I started to play with
one-liners and eventually with Shell Scripts. 

This continued in another ISP, where I could co-develop a captive portal, and
I could do some small changes on the PHP code, as I had to integrate the Shell
Scripts and one-liners used to do traffic shaping, firewalling, billing, SNMP,
among others.
