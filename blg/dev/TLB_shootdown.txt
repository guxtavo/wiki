A TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) is a cache of the translations from
virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses. When a processor
changes the virtual-to-physical mapping of an address, it needs to tell the
other processors to invalidate that mapping in their caches.

That process is called a "TLB shootdown".

A quick example:

   * You have some memory shared by all of the processors in your system.

   * One of your processors restricts access to a page of that shared memory.

   * Now, all of the processors have to flush their TLBs, so that the ones 
     that were allowed to access that page can't do so any more.

The actions of one processor causing the TLBs to be flushed on other
processors is what is called a TLB shootdown.
