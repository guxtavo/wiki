Top 10 tips from support (KCS's I'd like to see)

Kdump server

Having a "kdump server" will

If you are not sure kdump is operational on the affected system or if you don't know what is kdump[KB 6038], you need to test vmcore genaration with the following commands:  

   This might required one or several reboots. Open a ticket an attach a fresh sosreport

~~~
  # rhst kernel-debug help
    
      on -> enable panic tunables and starts kdump service
     off -> disable panic tunables and 
   sysrq -> triggers a sysrq+c   

  # rhst kernel-debug on
    Enabling kernel.sysrq
    Enabling kernel.panic
    Enabling kernel.hung_task_panic
    Enabling kernel.panic_on_oops
    Enabling kernel.panic_on_io_nmi
    Enabling kernel.panic_on_unrecovered_nmi
    Enabling kernel.panic_on_stackoverflow 
    Enabling kernel.softlockup_panic
    Enabling kernel.unknown_nmi_panic
    Enabling kernel.nmi_watchdog
    Enabling vm.panic_on_oom
    Starting kdump service
  # rhst kernel-debug sysrq
  After the reboot, vmcore will be located at $KDUMP_PATH

Configure a NFS share to receive 

  Pro tip: Available space should be calculated using the following formula:

           KMT = total amount of memory on all servers dumping to NFS share
                      

           KMT

When suspecting
  * Hardware fault
  * Constant unexpected reboots or hangs


Upload the vmcore to dropbox[KB xx] or to the ticket:
  
  # rhst -c xxxxx upload vmcore (1gb maximum size)

We are aware some users report problems with our dropbox. If you are having difficulties, either try again or provide a way to share the file yourself.

After capturing the vmcore core and uploading, make sure you disable kernel-debug mode

  # rhst kernel-debug off
