  Getting "BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#N" messages running RHEL on VMWare

"While these errors can happen for a number of different reasons, one potential cause is detailed by VMWare in their KB article, 1009996, for Linux kernels running on SMP enabled virtual machine. As mentioned, resources may be overcommitted across VMs resulting in some of them not being scheduled for a period of time."

"Many Linux kernels have a soft lockup watchdog thread, and report soft lockup messages if that watchdog thread does not get scheduled for more than 10 seconds. On a physical host, a soft lockup message generally indicates a kernel bug or hardware bug. When running in a virtual machine, this might instead indicate high levels of overcommitment (especially memory overcommitment) or other virtualization overheads."

It is known that the ballooning driver, due to host memory pressure, can cause such condition. If you believe the issue is not caused by high levels of overcommitment, the only way we can help you is by analyzing a vmcore captured at the moment the issue occurs. The following solutions will help you doing so:

========= v0.2 =============

Greetings, my name is Gustavo from the EMEA Kernel Team and I will assist you with this service request.

    "BUG:soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 10s! [init:1"

  Many Linux kernels have a soft lockup watchdog thread, and report soft
  lockup messages if that watchdog thread does not get scheduled for more
  than N seconds. On a physical host, a soft lockup message generally 
  indicates a kernel bug or hardware bug. When running in a virtual 
  machine, this might instead indicate high levels of overcommitment 
  (especially memory overcommitment) or other virtualization overheads.

Assuming you are running this VM on vmware (which we should confirm after
you send the sosreport), please find here another knowledge base solution
which describes the problem:

It is known that the ballooning driver, due to host memory pressure, can 
cause such condition. If you believe the issue is not caused by high 
levels of overcommitment, the only way we can help you is by analyzing a 
vmcore captured at the moment the issue occurs. The easiest way is by 
capturing a memory dump of the VM (giving solutions for both RHEV and 
Vmware:

  How do I capture a vmcore from a KVM or RHEV guest? 
  https://access.redhat.com/solutions/39604 

Another way to accomplish it is by configuring kdump to crash the system 
and generate a vmcore:

Once you capture the vmcore, please upload to our dropbox:

  > large sosreports, heap dumps, large log files, etc.) 
  _ https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2112

What do we have:
  1) soft lockup detected on vm (unable to login)
  2) Red Hat team provided explanation for the particular type of error message (KBs 22621, 21849)
  3) Further data is needed in order to troubleshoot the issue (KBs 411653, 39604, 6038, 19541, 2112)

Action plan:
  1) Capture and provide data for investigation

After you provide the vmcore, I will do the first analysis and point out
what I think is relevant. It would be appreciated if you could double check
what is the current resource utilization on the hypervisor, or even check 
the console for warnings and provide your findings so we can gather as 
much data we can to have a clear picture of the situation.

A softlockup means a kernel function is taking longer than expected to
complete and the process is active and running on the CPU.  It cannot be
backgrounded like a D state.  Since this is a virtual machine it has the
hallmarks of resource contention on the hypervisor.

1) You will want to utilize esxtop to examine the cpu %ready for this guest.
I believe VMWare's baseline is 5 percent.  This value is the amount of time
the guest is waiting to get time on the physical hardware for it's processing.
So if the %ready is say 50 percent the guest would spend half of it's time
waiting for the hypervisor to perform work for the guest.  VMWare has a guide
here:

  https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2001003

  You may want to open a parallel case with VMWare to have them validate the
  health of the hypervisor.
