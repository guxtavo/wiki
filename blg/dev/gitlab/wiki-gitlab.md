# Gustavo

Hi Cyndi, thanks for your message, looks very interesting. If you have
some free time this morning between 9-12 (CDT) you can call me at +420
774 091 877 so we can learn about each other. If for some reason the
time doesn't suit you, what about 8-10AM (CDT) on Friday? In the
meantime, I will start learning some ruby ;)

# Cyndi

Great to hear from you! Can you please send across your best email and a
copy of your resume so we may get the next steps coordinated?  Our
Support Engineer hiring process involves a short technical assessment, a
screening call with the Recruiter, and 3 interviews with the team.
Generally, the process takes 3-5 weeks and is all done on Zoom.

# Gustavo

Dear Cyndi, here is my I'm a shy person, so for the
first screening call I would like to have my camera off if this isn't a
problem.

We'll discuss:

    * your experience in general
    * what you're looking for
    * your experience with Linux and go over some basic commands
    * an overview of GitLab
    * ask any question you have
        - Is there a cli interface to zendesk - yes
        - Does the Support team use a cli interface to zendesk?
        - Does Gitlab have a cli tool? - yes
        - I like the bot that checks the code of conduct and closes tickets if
          they don't meet the standard :D
        - 

Categorization bot - issues pending: 4

# What am I looking for?

It might sound as a cliche, but I'm generally looking for

    * Increase my programming skills and grow
    * Work with skilled people that can teach me
    * Be able to be Open

Imagine a zendesk user, support-bot, has access to zendesk's api and can use
this api to post comments to tickets and read what's there.

Now imagine all comments made by all Support Engineers are not made directly by
them into zendesk's web interface, but are in fact a merge request in a git
repository.

The support-bot would run periodically, updating tickets, but only if the
comments are merged.

What is the benefit of this? Collaboration! By delaying the reply, we give
chance for everybody to chip in if necessary.

It precludes the existence of a binary system in which Support Engineers would
work on tickets, writting what is next for our customer, or reviewing other
tickets. The merge will only occur if a number of reviews is done. We can
assume that for every comment a Support Engineer made in a merge request, the
person has to review 2 other MRs.

The introduction of this will create great disturbance in the implementation.
But with the ability of submitting comments to zendesk via a bot, we can also
start automating the ticket categorization, which I assume everyone would agree
is the most painful aspect of support - the back and forth that can happen
until something starts happening.

This makes for a more collaborative approach, as anyone working on 1 ticket
will know what is going on with at least 2 other and the whole Support team
will have the ability to contribute to any ongoing ticket.

The problems with this are the disturbance on the implementation, concerns with
extra work.

# Extra work?

It is not the purpose to make you get deep into what is going on with your
colleague's ticket, we are looking for easy mistakes, don't put too much
cognitive load on reviewing the merges. We want your thumbs up or your
comments.

Newcomers  can only review MRs in the beginning and are free to make any
questions in order to make some detail clear in their jorney understanding the
product and how to debug it.

This will force Support Engineers to mentor newcomers, which will benefit the
whole organization.

For this to work, the Senior Support Engineers might need some form of
compensation, because they will be responsible for reviewing more stuff, and
are more likely to find issues with how the creator is communicating.

# bot modes

The bot could then be triggered by an api in order to initiate an automatic
posting for more data, perhaps the number one reason for delays.

These modes will exist to help categorizing the ticket and several actions can
be triggered such as:

    * ask for more data
    * ask a question to narrow down the categories
    * any action that is found to be repetive and made by the whole team

The idea is, a ticket created by a customer will have more than 0 issues,
things missing, and we can put a counter of those issues to our customer
saying, hey, I know this might be difficult to you, but if you make your
intentions a little bit more clear we can nail this together.

If a ticket is created and it has zero (nada) issues, then the customer must be
celebrated, perhaps the customers in which the count of zero-issue new tickets
is higher they can win some karma publicly or some reward.

# shallow tasks

Having such bot frees the Engineers from minial work to focus on fully
categorized tickets, which can dramatically reduce the time-to-close and
increase customer satisfaction

# timeline

In my experience customers can have problems detailing the event timeline 

# conclusion

This brings the Support Organization's operations inside Gitlab, how  more meta
this can be?
