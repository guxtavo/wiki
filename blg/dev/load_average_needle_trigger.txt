I presume you agree that when the load isn't greater than the number of cores,
it just represents all the cores are in use, which doesn't necessarily means
you have a performance issue, as there is no waste in resources. Non
starvation of cores can signify lack of capacity planning and performance
management. The proper mitigation to assert which component of your
distribution is causing the performance issue might incur in further
degradation.
