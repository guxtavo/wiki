Continuous integration, the kernel hacker way...

Displays my tmux window manager. I have 3 changes, 2 repos with modified
content and 1 with untracked files. I'm inside a git repo, on master branch,
and here there is no changes, this repo is clean, well, not until I create
this file, which then I see:

   master 1 |

Ok, I will now push some changes in one repo:

   master 1 | 1 | 

The only change I'm working right now is this very file. This will show me
the rough number of code I'm working on, which is roughly how many patches I
am currently dealing with.

The tmux status bar personalization along with bash are the building blocks of
my CI terminal. All is built on the following tools:

  linux bash tmux vi git

As a software engineer, if you give me access to a shell, that's all I really
need. I call this solution profile. My next openSUSE machine will be exactly
like this after I clone the repo and use the install script. Two steps and my
whole system is deployed as it was before.

This keeps my focus on producing patches for my own CI and as well for the
projects I participate.
