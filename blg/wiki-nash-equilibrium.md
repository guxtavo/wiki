    If each player has chosen a strategy—an action plan choosing its own action
    based on what it has seen happen so far in the game—and no player can
    increase its own expected payoff by changing its strategy while the other
    players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices
    constitutes a Nash equilibrium.
