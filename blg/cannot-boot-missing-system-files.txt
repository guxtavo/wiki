Greetings, my name is Gustavo from the EMEA Kernel Team and I will try to
collaborate with this ticket.

Although my knowledge is limited in storage, I suppose you could run fsck on
your filesystems to make sure they are not corrupted. You should be able to
mount at least the local devices (assuming you are booting from local disks),
if the fsck on the unmounted partitions (from rescue mode).

If your system has a remote management interface, did you check if there are
any issues there? 

/bin was missing

ystem cannot boot due to missing system files

RHEL 7.2

Note that this process may drop you to a prompt without access to a usb
keyboard, and does not work in a VM like KVM or VirtualBox. To reset the root
password in these environments

    remove rhgb
        add rd.break instead of init=/bin/sh to the line that starts with
        linux in
            Grub2
                run mount -o remount,rw /sysroot when the system boots
                    run chroot /sysroot
                        run passwd
                            run touch /.autorelabel
                                run exit to leave chroot
                                    run exit to logout

                                    check for missing files with "rpm -Va"
