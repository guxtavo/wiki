% clarity for "brazil burning trees vs the world" - a theory

There is a lot of "attacking" in the media about the fires in Brazil, and I
cannot understand many things.

Firstly, this is not Brazil alone. All 3 countries involved have a simple
attitude towards agriculture: the farmers burn because it is cheap. Now they
got a "license" from the goverment to "increase productivity".

This burning happens _every_ year, with different degrees of intensity, but
without missing, like a clock. The attention is proportional to the intensity
of the fires this year I guess.

Dial back a bit to what's the challenge in Brazil right now: economic crisis.

due to overspending in public pension, goverment misadministration, poor care
for economic mattersy and high corruption rates.

What problem are the farmers trying to solve? To have more food? More space for
agriculture? Do we need that to combat the economic crisis?

Other countries are already discussing what economic actions they will take
against Brazil. Should we expect the economic crisis to get worse if those
countries act? How much impact this will have for Brazil? The paradox here is
"why Mr. President is trying to hurt the economy which is already fragile?

What action needs to be take to avoid penalty for Brazil?

Should we educate the farmers or ourselves about finance?

I don't know the answers. What I do know is that it is the best time of the
year to be flying airtankers above the fire and forest. I cannot speak about
Mr. President.
