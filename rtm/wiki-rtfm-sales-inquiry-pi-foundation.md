Hello, my name is Gustavo and I'm a software engineer working in Linux
support. I want to inquiry about bulk buying the headerless 3a+[1] and
the keyboard[2] plus some services[3], but I'm not sure if you provide
those. By those I mean:

  * retrofitting the 3a+ inside the keyboard case with holes for audio
    jack, hdmi and usb
  * connecting the usb port from the 3a+ directly to the hub
  * adding a momentary switch connected to gpio's (power button)

I tried to DIY but soldering was very difficult and I accidentally
removed some component in the process[4] when removing the header. I
also damaged the micro usb from the hub as you can see.

The batch will be for 50 units. Looking forward for your answer.

Kind regards and huge admiration,

Gustavo
