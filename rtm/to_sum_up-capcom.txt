# Introduction letter

Gustavo (alias 'capcom' on IRC) is a self-reliant hacker (RFC 1983),
business-savvy, excels in communication (which enables him to easily
work with customers, partners, R&D and Support) and is always focused on
results.

Born in Brazil he works under a sponsored visa in Brno/CZ, where he has
been for the past 7 years, give or take.

    "While my first priority is to excel at my current role, my
    short-term objective (end of 2021) is to become proficient in _C_
    and increase my efforts towards system programming
    (kernel/low-level)."

When he is not working, Gustavo reads books, plays video games, watches
youtube hoping one day building his own camper van and enjoys flight
simulators.
