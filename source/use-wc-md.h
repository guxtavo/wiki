/* Performance Debugger Library - pdl
 *
 * "Utilization, Starvation and Errors" and "Workload Characterization" Methods Debugger 

   use-wc-md

program prototype

use-wc-md performs automated performance investigation based on two methodologies created by Brendan Greg:

  - Utilization, starvation and errors methodology (USE)
  - Workload characterization methodology

By using "needles", use-wc-md can collect the necessary data to create a report 

  usage: use-wc-md [--help]

  use-wc-md - USE and WC methods debugger
  use-wc-md - triggering needles to investigate performance
  -u 
     generate utilization points
  -s 
     generate starvation points
  -e
    generate errors poins
  -w 
    generate workload characterzation
  -p <PID>
     call strace -c on a process, to get system call stats 
  -t 
     run perf stat for needle_interval

 DESCRIPTION
        This command gathers performance data to be investigated. It uses the Âµ
        Concept of needles from OpenQA.
